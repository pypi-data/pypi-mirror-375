SPARCS uses automated high-speed laser microdissection to physically isolate phenotypic variants             in situ             from virtually unlimited library sizes. We demonstrate the potential of SPARCS in a genome-wide CRISPR-KO screen on autophagosome formation in 40 million cells. Coupled to deep learning image analysis, SPARCS recovered almost all known macroautophagy genes in a single experiment and discovered a role for the ER-resident protein EI24 in autophagosome biogenesis. Harnessing the full power of advanced imaging technologies, SPARCS enables genome-wide forward genetic screening for diverse spatial phenotypes             in situ             .},

However, the handling of uni- and multimodal spatial omics datasets remains a challenge owing to large data volumes, heterogeneity of data types and the lack of flexible, spatially aware data structures. Here we introduce SpatialData, a framework that establishes a unified and extensible multiplatform file-format, lazy representation of larger-than-memory data, transformations and alignment to common coordinate systems. SpatialData facilitates spatial annotations and cross-modal aggregation and analysis, the utility of which is illustrated in the context of multiple vignettes, including integrative analysis on a multimodal Xenium and Visium breast cancer study.},

  abstract     = {Single-cell proteomics by mass spectrometry is emerging as a powerful and unbiased method for the characterization of biological heterogeneity. So far, it has been limited to cultured cells, whereas an expansion of the method to complex tissues would greatly enhance biological insights. Here we describe single-cell Deep Visual Proteomics (scDVP), a technology that integrates high-content imaging, laser microdissection and multiplexed mass spectrometry. scDVP resolves the context-dependent, spatial proteome of murine hepatocytes at a current depth of 1,700 proteins from a cell slice. Half of the proteome was differentially regulated in a spatial manner, with protein levels changing dramatically in proximity to the central vein. We applied machine learning to proteome classes and images, which subsequently inferred the spatial proteome from imaging data alone. scDVP is applicable to healthy and diseased tissues and complements other spatial proteomics and spatial omics technologies.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning and in particular deep learning (DL) are increasingly important in mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics. Recent DL models can predict the retention time, ion mobility and fragment intensities of a peptide just from the amino acid sequence with good accuracy. However, DL is a very rapidly developing field with new neural network architectures frequently appearing, which are challenging to incorporate for proteomics researchers. Here we introduce AlphaPeptDeep, a modular Python framework built on the PyTorch DL library that learns and predicts the properties of peptides (https://github.com/MannLabs/alphapeptdeep). It features a model shop that enables non-specialists to create models in just a few lines of code. AlphaPeptDeep represents post-translational modifications in a generic manner, even if only the chemical composition is known. Extensive use of transfer learning obviates the need for large data sets to refine models for particular experimental conditions. The AlphaPeptDeep models for predicting retention time, collisional cross sections and fragment intensities are at least on par with existing tools. Additional sequence-based properties can also be predicted by AlphaPeptDeep, as demonstrated with a HLA peptide prediction model to improve HLA peptide identification for data-independent acquisition (https://github.com/MannLabs/PeptDeep-HLA).},

  abstract     = {Spatial omics data allow in-depth analysis of tissue architectures, opening new opportunities for biological discovery. In particular, imaging techniques offer single-cell resolutions, providing essential insights into cellular organizations and dynamics. Yet, the complexity of such data presents analytical challenges and demands substantial computing resources. Moreover, the proliferation of diverse spatial omics technologies, such as Xenium, MERSCOPE, CosMX in spatial-transcriptomics, and MACSima and PhenoCycler in multiplex imaging, hinders the generality of existing tools. We introduce Sopa (https://github.com/gustaveroussy/sopa), a technology-invariant, memory-efficient pipeline with a unified visualizer for all image-based spatial omics. Built upon the universal SpatialData framework, Sopa optimizes tasks like segmentation, transcript/channel aggregation, annotation, and geometric/spatial analysis. Its output includes user-friendly web reports and visualizer files, as well as comprehensive data files for in-depth analysis. Overall, Sopa represents a significant step toward unifying spatial data analysis, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of cellular interactions and tissue organization in biological systems.},

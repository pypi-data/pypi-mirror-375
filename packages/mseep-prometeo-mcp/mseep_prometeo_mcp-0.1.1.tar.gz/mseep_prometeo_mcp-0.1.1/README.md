---

## üì¶ Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) installed globally
- An API Key (Register at [Prometeo](https://prometeoapi.com) to get one!)

---

## üì• Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies with `uv`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/prometeoapi/prometeo-mcp.git
cd prometeo-mcp
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies (you can skip this step if you're running `uv run` directly inside an MCP-compatible LLM environment like Claude Desktop):

```bash
uv pip install -e .
```

## üß† Running the Application in MCP-Compatible LLMs

This project supports MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration and can be configured for execution inside LLM tools or agents that support external server launching.

Below are configuration examples for different LLMs:

### ü§ñ Claude Desktop (Anthropic)

Inside the Claude Desktop JSON config, add or extend the mcpServers section like this:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "PrometeoAPI": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "/your/path/to/host",
        "run",
        "prometeo_mcp/server.py"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PROMETEO_API_KEY": "your_api_key",
        "PROMETEO_ENVIRONMENT": "sandbox"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> Replace /your/path/to/host with the full absolute path on your system.
>
> Replace your_api_key with your Prometeo sandbox or production key.
>


### üß† OpenAI GPTs (via Plugins or Tool Use)

For GPTs that support calling tools via process launch (or via Agent toolchains like LangChain, AutoGen, etc.), use this shell command:

```bash
uv run prometeo_mcp/server.py
```

You can wrap this in a tool definition or ToolExecutor.

#### üïπÔ∏è OpenInterpreter / OpenDevin

```json
{
  "tools": {
    "PrometeoServer": {
      "type": "command",
      "exec": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "prometeo_mcp/server.py"
      ],
      "cwd": "/your/path/to/host",
      "env": {
        "PROMETEO_API_KEY": "your_api_key",
        "PROMETEO_ENVIRONMENT": "sandbox"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> Replace /your/path/to/host with the full absolute path on your system.
>
> Replace your_api_key with your Prometeo sandbox or production key.
>

#### üß™ LangChain (via Runnable or Tool)

For LangChain custom tools:

```python
from langchain.tools import Tool

prometeo_server_tool = Tool.from_function(
    name="PrometeoServer",
    func=lambda x: os.system("uv run prometeo_mcp/server.py"),
    description="Runs Prometeo API server"
)
```

##  üõ† Tools

### CURP Query Tools

#### `curp_query`

Allows you to validate and retrieve information associated with an existing CURP (Clave √önica de Registro de Poblaci√≥n) by providing the CURP code directly. This function is essential for verifying Mexican identity documents and obtaining associated personal data.

#### `curp_reverse_query`

Enables retrieval of a CURP by providing personal demographic data instead of the CURP itself. This function requires name, surnames, gender, birthdate, and state of registration to find the corresponding CURP.

---

### Account Validation Tools

#### `validate_account`

Validates bank account information across multiple Latin American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay) and the United States. This function verifies if an account exists and returns details about the account holder. It handles various account number formats including CLABE (Mexico), CBU/CVU (Argentina), CCI (Peru), and PIX keys (Brazil).

#### `get_validation_result`

Retrieves the status or result of a previously initiated account validation request. This is particularly useful for asynchronous validations that may take time to process through banking systems.

#### `get_tasks`

Retrieves information about system tasks and their statuses. This function is useful for monitoring background processes and understanding the overall system state.

---

### Banking Connection Tools

#### `banking_login`
Establishes a connection with a banking provider by authenticating user credentials. It handles multi-factor authentication scenarios by returning a session key that can be used for subsequent operations. If two-factor authentication is required, the function signals that an OTP (One-Time Password) is needed.

#### `banking_get_accounts`

Retrieves a list of all accounts associated with an authenticated banking session. This provides account numbers, types, balances, and other relevant details once a user is successfully logged in.

#### `banking_get_movements`

Obtains transaction history (movements) for a specific account within a defined date range. This function requires an active session key, account number, currency code, and the desired date range for the transactions.

#### `banking_logout`

Securely terminates an active banking session, ensuring proper cleanup of authentication tokens and session data.

---

### Cross Border Tools

#### `crossborder_create_intent`
Create a crossborder payin intent using the destination_id, concept, currency, amount, customer and external_id. Payins support: virtual account (MX) or QR code (BR, PE).

#### `crossborder_create_payout`
Create a crossborder payout transfer for the local rail. For MX uses SPEI, for BR uses PIX and for PE uses CCE.

#### `crossborder_get_intent`
Get a crossborder payin intent by intent_id. Able to get the status of the intent.

#### `crossborder_get_payout`
Get a crossborder payout transfer by payout_id. Able to get the status of the payout.

#### `crossborder_list_intents`
List all crossborder payin intents.

#### `crossborder_list_payouts`
List all crossborder payout transfers.

#### `crossborder_refund_intent`
Refund a crossborder payin intent. Only able to refund if the intent is in Settled status.

#### `crossborder_create_customer`
Create a crossborder customer. Customer is used for payins and payouts. If used for payins a QR or virtual account is created when calling the create_intent function. If used for payouts a withdrawal account is needed to perform the payout.

#### `crossborder_get_customer`
Get a crossborder customer by customer_id.

#### `crossborder_list_customers`
List all crossborder customers

#### `crossborder_update_customer`
Update a crossborder customer partial or full data.

#### `crossborder_add_withdrawal_account`
Add a withdrawal account to a crossborder customer. In scenarios that customer has more than one withdrawal account, the withdrawal account is selected by default.

#### `crossborder_select_withdrawal_account`
Select a withdrawal account for a crossborder customer. This is useful when customer has more than one withdrawal account.

#### `crossborder_get_accounts`
Get all accounts to the current merchant (API key assigned).

#### `crossborder_get_account`
Get a merchant account by account_id.

#### `crossborder_get_account_transactions`
Get all transactions for a merchant account by account_id.

##  OpenAPI Resources

### `openapi://all`

Lists all available OpenAPI resources. From this list you can select a resource to read.

### `openapi://{document_id}`

Reads a specific OpenAPI resource by its ID. From this resource you can generate client code to interact with the any Prometeo API.

---

### üí° Prompt Examples

üìÅ [`examples/prompts.md`](examples/prompts.md)

It contains example prompts you can copy and paste into Claude, ChatGPT (with MCP), or any other compatible LLM to trigger real server calls and test behavior.

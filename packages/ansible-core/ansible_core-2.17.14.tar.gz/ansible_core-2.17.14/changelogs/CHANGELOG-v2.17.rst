---------------

| Release Date: 2024-11-04
| `Porting Guide <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-core/2.17/porting_guides/porting_guide_core_2.17.html>`__

--------------

- include_vars action - Ensure that result masking is correctly requested when vault-encrypted files are read. (CVE-2024-8775)
- task result processing - Ensure that action-sourced result masking (``_ansible_no_log=True``) is preserved. (CVE-2024-8775)
- user action won't allow ssh-keygen, chown and chmod to run on existing ssh public key file, avoiding traversal on existing symlinks (CVE-2024-9902).

Bugfixes
--------

- Fix disabling SSL verification when installing collections and roles from git repositories. If ``--ignore-certs`` isn't provided, the value for the ``GALAXY_IGNORE_CERTS`` configuration option will be used (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/83326).
- Improve performance on large inventories by reducing the number of implicit meta tasks.
- Use the requested error message in the ansible.module_utils.facts.timeout timeout function instead of hardcoding one.
- ansible-test - Enable the ``sys.unraisablehook`` work-around for the ``pylint`` sanity test on Python 3.11. Previously the work-around was only enabled for Python 3.12 and later. However, the same issue has been discovered on Python 3.11.
- debconf - set empty password values (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/83214).
- facts - skip if distribution file path is directory, instead of raising error (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/84006).

---------------

| Release Date: 2024-10-07
| `Porting Guide <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-core/2.17/porting_guides/porting_guide_core_2.17.html>`__

- dnf5 - re-introduce the ``state: installed`` alias to ``state: present`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/83960)
- module_utils atomic_move (used by most file based modules), now correctly handles permission copy and setting mtime correctly across all paths

v2.17.4
=======

Release Summary
---------------

| Release Date: 2024-09-09
| `Porting Guide <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-core/2.17/porting_guides/porting_guide_core_2.17.html>`__

Bugfixes
--------

- Fix ``SemanticVersion.parse()`` to store the version string so that ``__repr__`` reports it instead of ``None`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/83831).
- Fix an issue where registered variable was not available for templating in ``loop_control.label`` on skipped looped tasks (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/83619)
- Fix for ``meta`` tasks breaking host/fork affinity with ``host_pinned`` strategy (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/83294)
- Fix using the current task's directory for looking up relative paths within roles (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82695).
- atomic_move - fix using the setgid bit on the parent directory when creating files (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/46742, https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/67177).
- connection plugins using the 'extras' option feature would need variables to match the plugin's loaded name, sometimes requiring fqcn, which is not the same as the documented/declared/expected variables. Now we fall back to the 'basename' of the fqcn, but plugin authors can still set the expected value directly.
- csvfile lookup - give an error when no search term is provided using modern config syntax (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/83689).
- include_tasks - Display location when attempting to load a task list where ``include_*`` did not specify any value - https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/83874
- powershell - Improve CLIXML decoding to decode all control characters and unicode characters that are encoded as surrogate pairs.
- psrp - Fix bug when attempting to fetch a file path that contains special glob characters like ``[]``
- runtime-metadata sanity test - do not crash on deprecations if ``galaxy.yml`` contains an empty ``version`` field (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/83831).

Minor Changes
-------------

- ansible-test - Update ``pypi-test-container`` to version 3.1.0.

Bugfixes
--------

- Fix rapid memory usage growth when notifying handlers using the ``listen`` keyword (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/83392)

- Fix using ``module_defaults`` with ``local_action``/``action`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/81905).
- fixed unit test test_borken_cowsay to address mock not been properly applied when existing unix system already have cowsay installed.
- powershell - Implement more robust deletion mechanism for C# code compilation temporary files. This should avoid scenarios where the underlying temporary directory may be temporarily locked by antivirus tools or other IO problems. A failure to delete one of these temporary directories will result in a warning rather than an outright failure.

v2.17.0
=======

Release Summary
---------------

| Release Date: 2024-05-20
| `Porting Guide <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-core/2.17/porting_guides/porting_guide_core_2.17.html>`__

- Added MIRACLE LINUX 9.2 in RedHat OS Family.
- Interpreter Discovery - Remove hardcoded references to specific python interpreters to use for certain distro versions, and modify logic for python3 to become the default.
- Use Python's built-in ``functools.update_wrapper`` instead an inline copy from Python 3.7.
- User can now set ansible.log to record higher verbosity than what is specified for display via new configuration item LOG_VERBOSITY.
- ``DEFAULT_PRIVATE_ROLE_VARS`` is now overridden by explicit setting of ``public`` for ``include_roles`` and ``import_roles``.
- ``ansible-galaxy role|collection init`` - accept ``--extra-vars`` to supplement/override the variables ``ansible-galaxy`` injects for templating ``.j2`` files in the skeleton.
- ``import_role`` action now also gets a ``public`` option that controls variable exports,  default depending on ``DEFAULT_PRIVATE_ROLE_VARS`` (if using defaults equates to ``public=True``).
- added configuration item ``TARGET_LOG_INFO`` that allows the user/author to add an information string to the log output on targets.
- ansible-doc - treat double newlines in documentation strings as paragraph breaks. This is useful to create multi-paragraph notes in module/plugin documentation (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/82465).
- ansible-doc output has been revamped to make it more visually pleasing when going to a terminal, also more concise, use -v to show extra information.
- ansible-galaxy - Started normalizing build directory with a trailing separator when building collections, internally. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/81619).
- ansible-galaxy dependency resolution messages have changed the unexplained 'virtual' collection for the specific type ('scm', 'dir', etc) that is more user friendly
- ansible-test - Add Alpine 3.19 container.
- ansible-test - Add Alpine 3.19 to remotes.
- ansible-test - Add Fedora 39 container.
- ansible-test - Add Fedora 39 remote.

- ansible-test - Bump the ``nios-test-container`` from version 2.0.0 to version 3.0.0.
- ansible-test - Containers and remotes managed by ansible-test will have their Python ``EXTERNALLY-MANAGED`` marker (PEP668) removed. This provides backwards compatibility for existing tests running in newer environments which mark their Python as externally managed. A future version of ansible-test may change this behavior, requiring tests to be adapted to such environments.
- ansible-test - Make Python 3.12 the default version used in the ``base`` and ``default`` containers.
- ansible-test - Remove Alpine 3(.18) container.
- ansible-test - Remove Alpine 3.18 from remotes.
- ansible-test - Remove Fedora 38 remote support.
- ansible-test - Remove Fedora 38 test container.
- ansible-test - Remove rhel/9.2 test remote

- ansible-test - Removed fallback to ``virtualenv`` when ``-m venv`` is non-functional.
- ansible-test - Removed test remotes: macos/13.2
- ansible-test - Removed the ``no-basestring`` sanity test. The test is no longer necessary now that Python 3 is required.
- ansible-test - Removed the ``no-dict-iteritems``, ``no-dict-iterkeys`` and ``no-dict-itervalues`` sanity tests. The tests are no longer necessary since Python 3 is required.
- ansible-test - Removed the ``no-main-display`` sanity test. The unwanted pattern is unlikely to occur, since the test has existed since Ansible 2.8.
- ansible-test - Removed the ``no-unicode-literals`` sanity test. The test is unnecessary now that Python 3 is required and the ``unicode_literals`` feature has no effect.
- ansible-test - Special handling for installation of ``cryptography`` has been removed, as it is no longer necessary.
- ansible-test - The ``shellcheck`` sanity test no longer disables the ``SC2164`` check. In most cases, seeing this error means the script is missing ``set -e``.
- ansible-test - The ``unidiomatic-typecheck`` rule has been enabled in the ``pylint`` sanity test.
- ansible-test - The ``unidiomatic-typecheck`` rule has been removed from the ``validate-modules`` sanity test.
- ansible-test - Update the base and default containers to use Ubuntu 22.04 for the base image. This also updates PowerShell to version 7.4.0 with .NET 8.0.0 and ShellCheck to version 0.8.0.
- ansible-test - Updated the CloudStack test container to version 1.7.0.
- ansible-test - Updated the distro test containers to version 6.3.0 to include coverage 7.3.2 for Python 3.8+. The alpine3 container is now based on 3.18 instead of 3.17 and includes Python 3.11 instead of Python 3.10.
- ansible-test - Updated the distro test containers to version 7.1.0.
- ansible-test - When ansible-test installs requirements, it now instructs pip to allow installs on externally managed environments as defined by PEP 668. This only occurs in ephemeral environments managed by ansible-test, such as containers, or when the `--requirements` option is used.
- ansible-test - When invoking ``sleep`` in containers during container setup, the ``env`` command is used to avoid invoking the shell builtin, if present.
- ansible-test - document block name now included in error message for YAML parsing errors (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82353).
- ansible-test - sanity test allows ``EXAMPLES`` to be multi-document YAML (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82353).
- ansible-test now has FreeBSD 13.3 and 14.0 support
- ansible.builtin.user - Remove user not found warning (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/80267)
- apt_repository.py - use api.launchpad.net endpoint instead of launchpad.net/api
- async tasks can now also support check mode at the same time.
- async_status now supports check mode.

- dnf5 - add the ``best`` option
- filter plugin - Add the count and mandatory_count parameters in the regex_replace filter

- import_role - allow subdirectories with ``_from`` options for parity with ``include_role`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82584).
- module argument spec - Allow module authors to include arbitrary additional context in the argument spec, by making use of a new top level key called ``context``. This key should be a dict type. This allows for users to customize what they place in the argument spec, without having to ignore sanity tests that validate the schema.
- modules - Add the ability for an action plugin to call ``self._execute_module(*, ignore_unknown_opts=True)`` to execute a module with options that may not be supported for the version being called. This tells the module basic wrapper to ignore validating the options provided match the arg spec.
- package action now has a configuration that overrides the detected package manager, it is still overridden itself by the use option.
- py3compat - Remove ``ansible.utils.py3compat`` as it is no longer necessary
- removed the unused argument ``create_new_password`` from ``CLI.build_vault_ids`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/82066).
- urls - Add support for TLS 1.3 post handshake certificate authentication - https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/81782
- urls - reduce complexity of ``Request.open``
- user - accept yescrypt hash as user password
- validate-modules tests now correctly handles ``choices`` in dictionary format.

Breaking Changes / Porting Guide
--------------------------------

- assert - Nested templating may result in an inability for the conditional to be evaluated. See the porting guide for more information.

Deprecated Features
-------------------

- Old style vars plugins which use the entrypoints `get_host_vars` or `get_group_vars` are deprecated. The plugin should be updated to inherit from `BaseVarsPlugin` and define a `get_vars` method as the entrypoint.
- The 'required' parameter in 'ansible.module_utils.common.process.get_bin_path' API is deprecated (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82464).
- ``module_utils`` - importing the following convenience helpers from ``ansible.module_utils.basic`` has been deprecated: ``get_exception``, ``literal_eval``, ``_literal_eval``, ``datetime``, ``signal``, ``types``, ``chain``, ``repeat``, ``PY2``, ``PY3``, ``b``, ``binary_type``, ``integer_types``, ``iteritems``, ``string_types``, ``test_type``, ``map`` and ``shlex_quote``.
- ansible-doc - role entrypoint attributes are deprecated and eventually will no longer be shown in ansible-doc from ansible-core 2.20 on (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82639, https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/82678).
- paramiko connection plugin, configuration items in the global scope are being deprecated and will be removed in favor or the existing same options in the plugin itself. Users should not need to change anything (how to configure them are the same) but plugin authors using the global constants should move to using the plugin's get_option().

Removed Features (previously deprecated)
----------------------------------------

- Remove deprecated APIs from ansible-docs (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/81716).
- Remove deprecated JINJA2_NATIVE_WARNING environment variable (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/81714)
- Remove deprecated ``scp_if_ssh`` from ssh connection plugin (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/81715).
- Remove deprecated crypt support from ansible.utils.encrypt (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/81717)
- Removed Python 2.7 and Python 3.6 as a supported remote version. Python 3.7+ is now required for target execution.
- With the removal of Python 2 support, the yum module and yum action plugin are removed and redirected to ``dnf``.

This matches the behavior of the Galaxy UI which also no longer implicitly removes the ``ansible-role-`` prefix. Use the ``--role-name`` option or add a ``role_name`` to the ``galaxy_info`` dictionary in the role's ``meta/main.yml`` to use an alternate role name.

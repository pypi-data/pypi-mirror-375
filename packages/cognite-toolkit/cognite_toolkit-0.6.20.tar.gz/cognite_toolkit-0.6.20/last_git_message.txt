[CDF-25685] ðŸ¤— Streamlit app entrypoint no longer required in metadata (#1918)

# Description

For streamlit apps the entrypoint is no longer required in the metadata
(the information is stored in the file content json). In addition, if
the hash of the code is not set, we now skip it instead of setting it to
missing.

## Changelog

# Problem Statement: Eliminate Defensive Programming

## Strategic Objective

Replace defensive programming patterns with fail-fast assertions to surface real architectural problems and align with DR methodology's "Fail Fast, Surface Problems" principle. This is foundational work that will reveal the actual issues hidden by complex error handling.

## Problem Context

The codebase contains extensive defensive programming that violates core DR methodology principles:

**Current State Violations**:
- **Try-catch blocks** in `figure.py` lines 392-424 and 454-503 hide actual problems
- **Error recovery logic** like `_handle_faceting_errors_gracefully` (732-776) masks underlying issues
- **Inconsistent error patterns**: Mix of assertions, print warnings, and silent failures
- **Import-time warnings** instead of failing loudly when dependencies missing

**Architectural Impact**: Defensive programming prevents users and developers from understanding real problems, leading to mysterious failures and difficult debugging.

**Evidence of Problems**:
```python
# From figure.py - hiding real validation issues
try:
    validate_faceting_data_requirements(...)
except ValidationError as e:
    print(f"Warning: {e}")  # Silent failure
    return  # Hide the problem
```

## Requirements & Constraints

### Must Preserve
- **All current functionality** - behavior changes only in error cases
- **Integration points** - external APIs must continue working
- **Type safety** - maintain complete type hints

### Must Change
- **Error handling strategy** - consistent fail-fast pattern
- **Validation approach** - assertions instead of complex validation chains
- **Import behavior** - fail immediately on missing dependencies

### Cannot Break
- **User data** - no risk to existing plot generation
- **External integrations** - matplotlib, pandas, etc. interactions
- **Public API contracts** - function signatures remain stable

## Decision Frameworks

### Error Handling Strategy Choice
**Option A**: Pure assertions with descriptive messages
**Option B**: Custom exception hierarchy with specific error types
**Option C**: Hybrid approach with assertions for validation, exceptions for external failures

**Decision Criteria**: 
- DR methodology favors immediate failure over graceful degradation
- Assertions provide clear, immediate feedback to developers
- Custom exceptions add complexity without clear benefit

**Recommended**: Option A (pure assertions) for internal validation, Option C for external dependencies

### Validation Approach
**Option A**: Centralize all validation in single module
**Option B**: Validate at component boundaries (constructors, method entry points)
**Option C**: Eliminate validation entirely, trust inputs

**Decision Criteria**:
- Early validation catches problems at source
- Component boundary validation aligns with atomicity principle
- Some validation is necessary for user-facing APIs

**Recommended**: Option B (component boundary validation)

### Import and Dependency Strategy
**Option A**: Fail immediately on missing optional dependencies
**Option B**: Runtime feature detection with clear error messages
**Option C**: Continue current warning approach

**Decision Criteria**:
- DR methodology prefers immediate problem surfacing
- Users should know immediately if environment is incomplete
- Graceful degradation masks configuration issues

**Recommended**: Option A (immediate failure with clear setup instructions)

## Success Criteria

### Behavioral Success
- **No silent failures** - all problems surface immediately with clear messages
- **Consistent error patterns** - predictable error behavior across all components
- **Fast failure** - problems detected at earliest possible point

### Code Quality Success
- **Assertion usage** - validation through descriptive assertions
- **Elimination of try-catch** - defensive error handling removed
- **Clear error messages** - users understand exactly what went wrong

### User Experience Success
- **Predictable behavior** - same input always produces same result or same error
- **Clear setup feedback** - immediate notification of environment issues
- **Better debugging** - problems point to root cause, not symptoms

## Quality Standards

**Reference**: Follow `docs/processes/design_philosophy.md` and `docs/processes/tactical_execution_guide.md`

**Key Principles**:
- **Fail Fast, Surface Problems**: Problems should surface immediately rather than being hidden by defensive programming
- **Architectural Courage**: Bold, clean solutions over incremental safety additions
- **Leave No Trace**: Completely eliminate defensive patterns, don't just reduce them

**Code Patterns to Implement**:
```python
# Instead of defensive handling
try:
    complex_operation()
except SomeError:
    print("Warning: operation failed")
    return default_value

# Use fail-fast assertions
assert condition, f"Clear description of what failed and why"
result = complex_operation()  # Let it fail if it fails
```

## Adaptation Guidance

### Expected Discoveries
- **Hidden bugs** will surface when defensive handling is removed
- **Configuration issues** will become visible when validation tightens
- **Dependency problems** will be exposed immediately

### How to Handle Edge Cases
- **If assertion is too strict**: Examine if the condition represents real invalid state
- **If external failures occur**: Consider if they indicate environmental problems that should fail fast
- **If tests break**: Update tests to match new fail-fast behavior

### Integration Strategy
- **Start with least-used code paths** to minimize user impact during transition
- **Work outward from core** to avoid cascading changes
- **Test thoroughly** to ensure no regressions in happy path

## Documentation Requirements

### Implementation Documentation
- **List of eliminated defensive patterns** with before/after code examples
- **New assertion patterns** established for future development
- **Breaking changes** (if any) in error handling behavior

### Strategic Insights
- **Hidden problems revealed** during defensive programming elimination
- **Root cause analysis** of what defensive programming was masking
- **Recommendations** for preventing defensive programming accumulation

### Future Reference
- **Error handling standards** for consistent application
- **Validation patterns** that align with DR methodology
- **Testing approaches** for fail-fast behavior validation

**Key Success Indicator**: When defensive programming is eliminated, the real architectural problems will become visible and addressable, setting foundation for subsequent simplification phases.

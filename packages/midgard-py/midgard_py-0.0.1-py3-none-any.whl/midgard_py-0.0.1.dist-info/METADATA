# Introduction
Python client for Midgard API

THORChain has several APIs - Midgard, THORNode, Cosmos RPC, CometBFT RPC. This python client focuses on interactions with Midgard API.

Built for Midgard Public API version 2.32.8.

[API Docs](https://midgard.ninerealms.com/v2/doc)

# Warning

I needed this to use only one endpoint, so first release will be very much useless for anyone. I will continue working on this and covering all API endpoints in the future when I have more free time.

# Progress

Below is the implementation status of the major sections of Midgard API in this Python client:

| Section      | Implemented | Notes |
|--------------|-------------|-------|
| Health Info  | ✅           |       |
| Pools List   | ✅           |       |

If you notice any discrepancy or want a section prioritized, please open an issue or PR.

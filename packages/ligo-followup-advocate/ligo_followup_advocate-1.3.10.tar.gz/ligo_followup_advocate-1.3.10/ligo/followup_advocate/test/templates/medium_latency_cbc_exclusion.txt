SUBJECT: Fermi GBM candidate with ID 702818765: Non-detection in gravitational waves

The LIGO Scientific Collaboration, the Virgo Collaboration, and the KAGRA
Collaboration report:

The PyGRB binary merger analysis [1] did not find a candidate gravitational
wave (GW) event associated with GRB Fermi GBM candidate with ID 702818765

Preliminary exclusion distances with the assumptions given below:

NS-NS: 212 Mpc, 90% CL

NS-BH: 354 Mpc, 90% CL


Exclusion distance from a Gaussian distribution of mass, uniform distribution
of spin and inclination. NS-NS: a Gaussian distribution of component masses 1-3
M_sun, uniform distributions of spin 0-0.4, and inclination angle up to a
maximum of 30 deg. NS-BH: as above for NS; BH mass and spin distributions 3-15
M_sun, 0-0.98.

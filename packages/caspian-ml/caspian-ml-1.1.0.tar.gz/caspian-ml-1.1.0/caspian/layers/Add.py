    '''
    A simple operation layer used to add arrays any number of arrays together.

    On a backward pass, will return the given gradient with no other modifications.

    Notes
    -----
    This layer can NOT be put into a standard Sequence layer, as it requires more than one input
    to function properly. A custom model which incorporates this layer must be created for it to
    function in a Sequence.

    This layer can also not be saved or loaded from a file, as it does not take any parameters.

            The data arrays that the forward pass will be performed on. Each array must have the

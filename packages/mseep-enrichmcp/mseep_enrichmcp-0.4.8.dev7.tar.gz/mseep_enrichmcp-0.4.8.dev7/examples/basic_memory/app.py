"""Simple API demonstrating the in-memory note utilities.

This example exposes a tiny CRUD interface for notes grouped into a single
``MemoryProject``. Notes are stored in ``./data`` using ``FileMemoryStore``
which writes Markdown files with YAML front matter. Listing notes only returns
their identifiers and titles while ``get_note`` returns the full content.

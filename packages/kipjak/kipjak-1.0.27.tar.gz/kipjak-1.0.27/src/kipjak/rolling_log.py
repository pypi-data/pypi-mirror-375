"""Self-maintaining storage as a FIFO of files.

Creates and maintains a series of files where each
file contains a time-slice of logs. New lines are added
to the end of the latest file until that reaches a
maximum size. At which point a new file is "tacked on" at
the end. Oldest files are deleted as necessary.

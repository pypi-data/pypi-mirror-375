PERSONAL EMAIL:
Subject: Vacation Plans for Next Month

Hi Sarah,

How are you doing? I hope everything's going well with the new job! I've been thinking about our conversation last month about taking a short vacation together, and I wanted to follow up.

I checked some options for that beach town we talked about, and there are some great deals for the weekend of the 15th. I found a cute rental cottage about two blocks from the beach for $180/night, which seems reasonable if we split it. The weather should be perfect that time of year too.

Let me know if you're still interested and if those dates work for you. I could book it this week to secure the place before summer rates kick in.

Can't wait to catch up properly!

Talk soon,
Michael

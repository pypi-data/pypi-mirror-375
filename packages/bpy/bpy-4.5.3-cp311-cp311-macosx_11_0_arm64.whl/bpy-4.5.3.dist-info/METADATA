# Blender

[Blender](https://www.blender.org) is the free and open source 3D creation suite. It supports the entirety of the 3D pipeline: modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing and motion tracking, even video editing.

This package provides Blender as a Python module for use in studio pipelines, web services, scientific research, and more.

### Archived Versions

Blender versions outside the current LTS window are removed from PyPI but are available at [https://download.blender.org/pypi/bpy/](https://download.blender.org/pypi/bpy/).

These versions can still be installed manually. For example, to install version 3.6.0:

```bash
pip install bpy==3.6.0 --extra-index-url https://download.blender.org/pypi/
```

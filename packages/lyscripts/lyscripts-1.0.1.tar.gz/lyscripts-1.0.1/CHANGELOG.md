# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.1] - 2025-09-10

- Use bug-fixed lydata `.ly.enhance()` method.

### Documentation

- Update documentation for `integrate` and `evidence` commands.
- Improve `data collect` description.

### Features

- Add `integrate` command for thermodynamic integration. Thanks [@noemibuehrer]!
- Add command spawning websever for interactive data collection.

### Miscellaneous Tasks

- Add missing links to changelog.
- Add CITATION.cff.

### Testing

- Update tests for new lydata.

### Build

- Add uvicorn, fastapi to deps.
- Require at least lydata 0.4.0.

### Change

- Make compatible with new lyDATA version.
- Centralize inverse temperature schedule generation.
- Store selected log-level globally.
- Disable properties in collector.

## [1.0.0rc3] - 2025-07-22

### Documentation

- Fix `join` command's example call.

### Features

- Add `data fetch` command. Fixes [#75].

### Change

- Access data only via lydata for compatibility.\
  We have changed the lydata 2nd level headers slightly for the
  patient and tumor info (see
  https://github.com/lycosystem/lydata/issues/21 for more info).\
  Since the lydata package was already updated to be compatible with
  that change, we simply need to route every access the lyscripts
  make to the data through lydata package and hence be compatible
  too.
- Make CLI work with new lydata format.\
  This is also related to https://github.com/lycosystem/lydata/issues/21

## [1.0.0rc2] - 2025-06-26

### Bug Fixes

- Divide by midext prevalence. Fixes [#72].\
  This fixes a bug we reintroduced where we didn't compute observed and
  model prevalence in an analogous and comparable way.

### Documentation

- Fix build badge in README.
- Fix outdated links to rmnldwg.

### Miscellaneous Tasks

- Update pre-commit & ruff rules.

### Testing

- Fix the dataset used for testing prevalences.

### Build

- Switch to `src` layout. Fixes [#74].

### Ci

- Use tests action with coverage.

## [1.0.0rc1] - 2025-05-27

### Bug Fixes

- Use 'fork' start method under MacOS.
- Specify config file encoding for other OSes.
- Cast scenario pattern to bool if possible. Fixes [#70].\
  Since we allow defining a pattern with keywords like `"involved"` or `1`
  instead of only `True`, we also need to make sure that is correctly cast
  to its boolean value for lydata's `C` objects.

### Documentation

- Add warning for Windows & MacOS regarding multiprocess(ing).

### Miscellaneous Tasks

- Add link to changelog.

### Testing

- Ensure observed prevalence is correct. Related [#70].

### Build

- Exclude buggy pydantic-settings. <https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-settings/issues/605> is present in
version 2.9.0 and 2.9.1 of pydantic-settings. So, these versions must be
excluded.

### Ci

- Update release scripts to use [OIDC](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/). This is more secure.

### Remove

- Unnecessary custom help formatter.

## [1.0.0.a7] - 2025-04-15

### Bug Fixes

- Make config -> model -> config round trip test pass.
- Remove `thin_by` factor in wrong place.
- Pass involvement & diagnosis correctly to risks and prevalences.

### Features

- Create Modality config from model.
- Create Graph config from model.
- Create Model config from model.

Note that the three features above come with certain limitations. It is not possible
to export all aspects of a model to a configuration. Especially the distributions
over diagnosis times cannot be converted to a `DistributionConfig`.

### Miscellaneous Tasks

- Fix changelog version link.
- Update ly schema.

### Testing

- Round trip config -> model -> config.

### Merge

- Branch 'main' into 'dev'.
- Branch 'configs-from-model' into 'dev'.\
  Constructing configs from models is only partially possible with the
  current implementation of the `lymph` model.

## [1.0.0.a6] - 2025-03-12

### Bug Fixes

- Better handle midline model. \
  This means disabling the evolution over midline extension. Also, since the new
  version of `lymph-model`, the `midext_prob` parameter is not epected to be the
  first one anymore when passed to `set_params()`.
- Pass only ipsilateral diagnosis to unilateral model.
- Pass diagnose & involvement correctly to models as dict.

### Testing

- Ensure unilateral model receives correct diagnosis.
- Test that diagnosis is used correctly in posteriors.

### Build

- Bump lydata & lymph-model dependency.

## [1.0.0.a5] - 2025-02-05

### Bug Fixes

- Provide rich `console` to compute progress bars.
- Correctly build deprecated models.

### Features

- Enable sampling only named parameter subset.

### Testing

- Check model construction & named params.
- Update integration test config YAML files.
- Add external model symbol check.
- Adding dists works correctly.\
  Previously, it could happen that in a `Bilateral` or `Midline` model the
  individual submodel's distributions where not synced.

### Build

- Bump lymph-model.

### Change

- Require every YAML file to have `version`.
- Better version-related error and docs.
- Make in-/output names more consistent.

### Remove

- Drop CLI required argument `version`.

## [1.0.0.a4] - 2025-01-23

### Bug Fixes

- Update data loading to new lydata API.
- Add sampling config back to sample CLI.
- Finish `data filter` command.
- Correctly log number of excluded pateints in `lyproxify`.
- Allow extra args in CLI cmds.
- Logging during progress bar.

### Documentation

- Deactivate help of removed commands.
- Link only to stable versions.
- Fix intersphinx links.
- Update link to schedule module.
- Configure how pydantic models are displayed.
- Add more info about schema.
- Better explain sampling.
- Add proper info to `cli_cmd()` methods.

### Features

- Add mandatory `version` field to command settings.\
  This will allow to differentiate between old and new configs and create
  the models accordingly.
- Add translation of old to new model configs.
- Add dynamic YAML config source.
- Configure logging nicely.
- Update `data enhance` command.
- Update `data join` command.
- Update `data filter` command.
- Update `data split` command.
- Capture lydata logging output.
- Update YAML schema for CLIs.
- Update `data lyproxify` cmd.
- Allow sampling only specified params.\
  Via a new CLI arg named `param_names` one may restrict the parameters
  sampled to a named subset. In combination with the fact that any Python
  model may be loaded, this results in an enormously flexible sampler.
- Update inv temp `schedule` cmd.
- Allow providing start state to sampling func.

### Testing

- Replace subprocess calls with monkeypatch.\
  This allows for better debugging during test calls.
- Load generated data correctly.\
  The synthetic data for testing already has "early" and "late" as
  T-stages. Thus, the mapping needed to be adapted.

### Build

- pydantic-settings >= 2.7 needed.

### Change

- Make `version` field in command settings required.
- Use pydantic for subcommands.
- Use loguru over default logging.
- Rename `data` field to `input`.
- Use pydantic for plot utils, too.
- Use rich logging handler.

### Refac

- Slightly change CLI inheritances.
- Sort configs alphabetically.
- Make sampling more reusable.

### Remove

- Unused utility functions.
- Plotting scripts except histogram/betaposterp helpers.

## [1.0.0.a3] - 2024-11-15

### Bug Fixes

- (**plot**) Turn off label by passing `None`.
- (**plot**) Don't fail on wrong wrong in `.draw()`.
- Polish dataclass configuration.
- Make pydantic work with subparsers.
- (**data**) Correct argument name of save function.
- (**comp**) Add distributions & fix dir type for priors.
- (**config**) Don't thin samples twice.

### Documentation

- (**configs**) Add to sphinx docs.
- Add intersphinx link to lydata.
- (**config**) Improve `construct_model` docstring.
- Correct copyright year.
- Clean up refs to deleted modules.
- Fix links to documentation in readme.

### Features

- (**config**) Write new methods to assemble model.
- (**plot**) Add func `split_legends()`. Related [#60].\
  This allows the user to separate many plot's labels into a number of
  different legends.
- (**configs**) Add graph config.
- (**sample**) Better config management.\
  The new sample command can merge configurations from multiple YAML files
  as well as the command line. It does a better job at reporting progress
  when the log-level is set to debug and it more consistently stores
  samples and metric logs during burn-in.
- (**sample**) Add JSON schema for params.\
  With this JSON schema one can get auto-completion in most popular
  code editors for the configs of most commands.
- (**config**) Allow loading external model.\
  It is now possible to not only specify a model using a fixed YAML
  schema, but also via a plain Python file that defines a global `model`
  variable.
- (**sample**) Add inverse temperature.\
  With this addition, it is now in principle possible to do thermodynamic
  integration. But it is not yet fully fleshed out for a nice user
  experience.
- Add tiny script to generate JSON schema.\
  The script creates a JSON schema based on all CLI commands' settings.
- (**comp**) Rewrite posteriors command that uses pydantic and joblib
- (**comp**) Rewrite risks command that uses pydantic and joblib
- (**sample**) Add iterations/second column to burnin progress display.
- (**sample**) Show total iterations to sampling progress display.
- (**config**) Allow converting diagnosis to involvement.
- (**compute**) Rewrite prevalence command that uses pydantic and joblib

### Miscellaneous Tasks

- Bump pre-commit hooks.
- Add ruff linting rules.
- Switch to ruff, drop pycln & isort.
- Run ruff & clean up codebase.
- Ignore some ruff rules in tests dir.

### Styling

- More cleanup to satisfy ruff.
- Improve docstrings and code style a bit.

### Testing

- Add some basic testing for config.
- (**data**) Basic integration test for `generate`.
- Add sampling step to integration tests.
- (**config**) Check the external loading feature.
- Extend & unify integration test for priors.

### Build

- Remove upper cap in dependencies.
- Bump lymph-model to 1.2.3.
- Remove `dev` from optional dependencies.\
  This is because a lot of dev tools like ruff, pre-commit, ... are
  installed globally (e.g. with pipx) instead of per venv.
- Bump `lydata` dependency to 0.2.0.

### Change

- (**plot**) Improve beta post & hist. Fixes [60].\
  The histograms and beta posteriors are now better implemented, allowing
  a user to extend the `draw()` function's abilities by adding classes
  similar to `Histogram` and `BetaPosterior`.
- (**plot**) More flexible labels.
- Use pydantic over dacite.
- Switch to pydantic config for sampling (WIP).
- (**compute**) Use pydantic & joblib over dataclasses and custom caching.
- ⚠ **BREAKING** (**compute**) Add priors joblib cache
- ⚠ **BREAKING** (**data**) Replace the `generate` cmd.\
  This was just supposed to be a little script to generate data for an
  integration test, but it turns out that it could just be used to update
  the old `generate` command.
  BREAKING CHANGES: `generate` command is better configurable
- (**config**) Merge sample/sampling configs.
- Use lydata's `ModalityConfig`.\
  Since the [lydata](https://github.com/lycosystem/lydata) package is
  evolving quickly, I added it as a dependency and moved the first bit of
  code over there.
- Enable use of lydata to load patient data.
- (**comp**) HDF5 file storage more versatile.
- (**sample**) Store history in .tmp file.\
  This serves an indication about whether or not a burn-in sampling round
  has been interrupted. The sampler may then continue from where it left off.
- ⚠ **BREAKING** (**compute**) Update prevalence computation.
- More useful YAML load/merge logging.
- Improve logging of some utilities.

### Remove

- Outdated streamlit app.
- Temporary test file.
- Delete remaining streamlit code.
- ⚠ **BREAKING** Unused HDF5 cache and scenarios.\
  Both these things are superseded by better stuff based on pydantic.

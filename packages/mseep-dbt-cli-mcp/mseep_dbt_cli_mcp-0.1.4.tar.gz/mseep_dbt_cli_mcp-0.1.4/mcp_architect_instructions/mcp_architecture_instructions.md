# MCP Architecture Planning Guide

This guide outlines the process for planning Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementations in Python.

## Planning Process Overview

Follow these steps sequentially when designing a new MCP server:

1. **Gather Requirements**
2. **Define Features and Edge Cases**
3. **Create Architecture**
4. **Break Down Implementation Tasks**
5. **Define Testing Strategy**
6. **Finalize Implementation Plan**

## Step 1: Gather Requirements

Use the [requirements questionnaire](templates/requirements_questionnaire.md) to collect essential information about:

- Core purpose and capabilities
- Input/output specifications
- External dependencies
- Constraints and limitations
- Edge cases to handle

Focus on gathering specific, actionable requirements that directly influence implementation decisions.

## Step 2: Define Features and Edge Cases

Based on requirements, define:

- **Core Features**: Essential capabilities
- **Edge Cases**: Unusual situations that must be handled
- **Error Scenarios**: Failure modes and responses
- **Performance Considerations**: Speed, memory, or resource constraints

Reference the [implementation guide](guides/implementation_guide.md) for details on MCP component types (Tools, Resources, Prompts).

## Step 3: Create Architecture

Design the high-level architecture:

1. Identify major components
2. Define component responsibilities
3. Map interactions between components
4. Create a component diagram using Mermaid
5. Document key design decisions

Focus on clear separation of concerns and maintainable design.

## Step 4: Break Down Implementation Tasks

Divide implementation into discrete, well-defined tasks:

1. Use the [task template](templates/task_template.md)
2. Ensure each task has:
   - Clear objective
   - Detailed specifications
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Testing requirements
   - Dependencies

See the [task example](examples/task_example.md) for reference.

**Important:** All task definitions should be placed in a `tasks/` directory within the `planning/` directory, as specified in the [project structure guide](guides/project_structure_guide.md).

## Step 5: Define Testing Strategy

Specify how each component and the system will be tested:

1. Unit testing approach
2. Integration testing strategy
3. End-to-end testing plan
4. Edge case coverage
5. Performance testing (if applicable)

Follow the [testing guide](guides/testing_guide.md) for best practices.

## Step 6: Finalize Implementation Plan

Consolidate all planning into a structured implementation plan:

1. Use the [implementation plan template](templates/implementation_plan_template.md)
2. Include project overview, architecture, and tasks
3. Document dependencies between tasks
4. Set up work progress tracking using the [work progress template](templates/work_progress_log_template.md)
5. Store all planning artifacts in the `planning/` directory (implementation plan, tasks, and work progress log)

See the [planning example](examples/planning_example.md) for reference.

## Planning Artifacts Organization

Per the [project structure guide](guides/project_structure_guide.md), all planning artifacts must be colocated in the project's `planning/` directory:

```
my-mcp-server/
├── planning/                 # Planning artifacts directory
│   ├── implementation_plan.md # Main implementation plan
│   ├── work_progress_log.md  # Progress tracking
│   └── tasks/                # Task definitions
│       ├── T1_Project_Setup.md
│       ├── T2_Component1.md
│       └── T3_Component2.md
```

This organization ensures that all planning-related documents are kept together and easily referenced during implementation.

## Implementation Preparation

After completing the plan:

1. Set up the environment per the [environment setup guide](guides/environment_setup_guide.md)
2. Create project structure following the [project structure guide](guides/project_structure_guide.md)
3. Implement each task in the specified order
4. Track progress in the work progress log
5. Register the completed MCP server as detailed in the [registration guide](guides/registration_guide.md)

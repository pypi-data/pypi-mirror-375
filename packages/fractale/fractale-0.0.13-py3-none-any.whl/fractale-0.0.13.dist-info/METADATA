> Translation layer for a jobspec specification to cluster execution

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/fractale.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/fractale)

This library is primarily being used for development for the descriptive thrust of the Fractale project. It is called fractale, but also not called fractale. You can't be sure of the name until you open the box.

## Design

### Agents

The `fractale agent` command provides means to run build, job generation, and deployment agents.
This part of the library is under development. There are three kinds of agents:

 - `step` agents are experts on doing specific tasks (do hold state)
 - `manager` agents know how to orchestrate step agents and choose between them (don't hold state, but could)
 - `helper` agents are used by step agents to do small tasks (e.g., suggest a fix for an error)

The design is simple in that each agent is responding to state of error vs. success. In the case of a step agent, the return code determines to continue or try again. In the case of a helper, the input is typically an erroneous response (or something that needs changing) with respect to a goal.
For a manager, we are making a choice based on a previous erroneous step.

See [examples/agent](examples/agent) for an example, along with observations, research questions, ideas, and experiment brainstorming!

### Job Specifications

#### Simple

We provide a simple translation layer between job specifications. We take the assumption that although each manager has many options, the actual options a user would use is a much smaller set, and it's relatively straight forward to translate (and have better accuracy).

See [examples/transform](examples/transform) for an example.

#### Complex

We want to:

1. Generate software graphs for some cluster (fluxion JGF) (this is done with [compspec](https://github.com/compspec/compspec)
2. Register N clusters to a tool (should be written as a python module)
3. Tool would have ability to select clusters from resources known, return
4. Need graphical representation (json) of each cluster - this will be used with the LLM inference

See [examples/fractale](examples/fractale) for a detailed walk-through of the above.

For graph tool:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge graph-tool
```

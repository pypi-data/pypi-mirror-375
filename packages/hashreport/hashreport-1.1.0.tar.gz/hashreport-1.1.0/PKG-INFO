## Overview

**hashreport** is a command-line tool that generates comprehensive hash reports for files within a directory. The reports can be output in CSV or JSON formats and include detailed information such as the file name, path, size, hash algorithm, hash value, and last modified date. Designed for speed and efficiency, **hashreport** can handle large volumes of files and offers filtering options to include or exclude files based on size, type, or name patterns.

> **Beta Release**: This project is currently in beta. While feature-complete and well-tested, please report any issues you encounter.

## Features

### Core Features
- Multi-threaded processing for fast bulk hash generation
- Support for multiple hash algorithms (MD5, SHA-256, etc.)
- Recursive directory traversal
- Comprehensive file information in reports

### Output Options
- CSV and JSON report formats
- Customizable output location
- Report viewer and comparison tool
- Email report delivery via SMTP

### Filtering Capabilities
- Filter by file size (min/max)
- Filter by file type and name patterns
- Include/exclude file lists
- Processing limits and controls

## Installation

There are a two ways to install **hashreport** on your system. Choose the option that works best for you:

### Install with Pip

You can install **hashreport** using `pip` from the Python Package Index ([PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/hashreport/)):

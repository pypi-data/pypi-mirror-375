Uber is believed to be filing for its IPO in April, and this move may give investors more reason to participate in the upcoming sale. It is rare for Uber to purchase a competitor rather than back out of a market, and Uber probably won't make more of these kinds of deals unless it gains more from it than just additional passengers."

Reddit has allowed video uploads since 2017, but its video-editing tools are limited. Dubsmash has declined to share its total number of users, but its share of the USA's short-form video market is second only to TikTok. Reddit specifically cited Dubsmash's user base as a reason for its acquisition."

Scientists from the University of Tennessee have developed a technique that involves using a plant-based additive to stop the formation of these crystals. The technique was inspired by the structure and functionality of antifreeze proteins found in plants and animals that thrive in sub-zero temperatures. It could prove useful in the cryopreservation of cells, tissues, and organs. The additive could be in products within the next five years."

Researchers have used this phenomenon to create a proof-of-concept quantum battery. The larger the battery was, the faster it charged, demonstrating superabsorption at work. Quantum battery research could result in fast-charging electric vehicles or energy storage systems that can deal with bursts of energy."

                Pir files also begin with '>', but they also recognize the ';' after the '>' and 2 letter symbol.\n
                When the Pir recognizes its format, it returns a 2.\n
                So, when the Pir format is recognized, it's preferred over the Fasta Format,
                 when both of them can load the alignment bur pir extracts more information.</i>\n

*ToMaChess* (**To**urnament **Ma**nagement for **Chess**) is a python module for managing chess tournaments.
For the older GUI application of the same name check out [tomachess-gui](https://github.com/Moritz72/tomachess-gui).

## Status

This project is still in its infancy but will hopefully be later used in the aforementioned GUI application
whilst still supporting all previously implemented functionality and more.

For some early results run the examples i.e.

````bash
python ./examples/round_robin.py
````

and

````bash
python ./examples/round_robin_team.py
````

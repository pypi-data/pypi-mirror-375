    faces : list[list[int]]
        The faces defined as list of indices in the points list.
    nmax : int, optional

        A dictionary mapping face identifiers (keys) to lists of neighboring faces.

    Notes
    -----
    This algorithm is used primarily to unify the cycle directions of the faces representing a mesh.
    The premise is that the faces don't have unified cycle directions yet,
    and therefore cannot be used to construct the adjacency structure. The algorithm is thus
    purely geometrical, but uses a spatial indexing tree to speed up the search.

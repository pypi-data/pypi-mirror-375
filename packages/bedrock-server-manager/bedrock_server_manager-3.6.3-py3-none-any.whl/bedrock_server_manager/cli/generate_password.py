# bedrock_server_manager/cli/generate_password.py
"""Provides a CLI utility to generate secure password hashes for Web UI authentication.

This module contains a single Click command, ``bsm generate-password``,
which interactively prompts the user for a password, confirms it, and then
outputs a bcrypt hash of that password.

The generated hash is intended to be used as the value for the
``BSM_PASSWORD`` (or equivalent, based on :const:`~.config.const.env_name`)
environment variable, which is used to secure the Bedrock Server Manager
web interface. This approach ensures that plaintext passwords are not
stored or directly used in configurations.

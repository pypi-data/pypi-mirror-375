Jungfrau control system integration with FastCS

This is where you should write a short paragraph that describes what your module does,
how it does it, and why people should use it.

:---:           | :---:
PyPI            | `pip install fastcs-jungfrau`

This is where you should put some images or code snippets that illustrate
some relevant examples. If it is a library then you might put some
introductory code here:

```python
from fastcs_jungfrau import __version__

print(f"Hello fastcs_jungfrau {__version__}")
```

Or if it is a commandline tool then you might put some example commands here:

```
python -m fastcs_jungfrau --version
```

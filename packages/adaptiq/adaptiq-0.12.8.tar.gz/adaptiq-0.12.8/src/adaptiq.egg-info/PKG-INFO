## 🤔 Why AdaptiQ?

AdaptIQ addresses the critical challenge of optimizing AI agent performance through intelligent, data-driven approaches. Our framework transforms the traditionally manual and error-prone process of agent tuning into a systematic, reinforcement learning-powered optimization workflow that learns from execution patterns and continuously improves agent behavior while reducing costs and resource consumption.

| Pain point | Traditional workaround | **AdaptiQ advantage** |
|------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Prompt/agent errors discovered **after** expensive runs | Manual review, trial‑and‑error | Detects & fixes issues **before** execution |
| GPU/LLM cost spikes | Spreadsheet audits | Predicts € & CO₂ inline |
| No common prompt style | Word/PDF guidelines | Enforced by lint rules, autofixable |
| Dev ↔ FinOps gap | Slack + e‑mails | Same CLI / dashboard for both teams |

---

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 📋 Prerequisites

Before installing AdaptIQ, ensure you have:

- **Python 3.12+** - Required for AdaptIQ framework
- **CrewAI framework** - Set up and configured for your agents (only supported framework)
- **OpenAI API key** - For LLM provider access
- **Windows OS** - Linux and Mac support not tested yet

### 📦 Installation

First, install UV package manager:

```bash
# Windows (PowerShell)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

> ⚠️ **Note**: Linux and Mac support is not tested yet. We recommend using Windows for now.

Then activate your virtual environment and install AdaptIQ:

```bash
uv pip install adaptiq
```

For development mode:
```bash
uv pip install -e .
```

### 🪄 Quick Setup

**Initialize a new project:**

```bash
adaptiq init --name name_project --template framework_template --path ./my_project
```

> 📝 **Note**: Only **CrewAI** is supported as the framework template currently.

This will initialize a project with `adaptiq_config.yml` that you should configure.

### 🔧 Configuration Validation

**Validate your configuration:**
```bash
adaptiq validate --config_path adaptiq_yml_path --template framework_template
```

### 🎮 Running AdaptIQ

AdaptIQ will run the optimization process automatically once the agent is in execution.

> 📝 **Important**: AdaptIQ currently supports only **CrewAI** as the agentic framework, **OpenAI** as the provider, and **GPT-4.1** and **GPT-4.1-mini** as the LLMs for the workflow. Other models and frameworks have not been tested yet.

## 🧠 How It Works (RL + Q-table)

### 🎯 ADAPTIQ - Agent Development & Prompt Tuning Iteratively with Q-Learning

ADAPTIQ is a framework designed for the iterative improvement of AI agent performance through offline Reinforcement Learning (RL). Its primary goal is to systematically enhance an agent's guiding Configuration, focusing mainly on its Task Description (Prompt), by learning from the agent's past execution behaviors and incorporating user validation. It provides a structured, data-driven alternative to purely manual prompt engineering.

### 🚀 Vision and Goal

Adaptiq's mission is to optimize agent behavior by refining its core instructions (prompts/task descriptions). It achieves this by analyzing what an agent intended to do (from its prompt), what it actually did (from execution logs), and how effective those actions were (via a multi-faceted reward system). It is especially suited for agents using frameworks like CrewAI, LangChain, etc., where direct, real-time RL control is often impractical.

### 🔧 Key Concepts in Adaptiq

#### 🧩 State (s)
Represents the agent's situation at a specific step, defined by features like:

- **Current_SubTask**: The immediate objective
- **Last_Action_Taken**: The previous validated ARIC strategic action
- **Last_Outcome**: The validated result of the previous action
- **Key_Context**: Accumulated relevant information (validated flags/data)

States are transformed into consistent, hashable representations for Q-table storage, potentially using generalization techniques.

#### 🎯 Action (a)
A selection from a predefined menu of discrete, strategic actions (e.g., Use_Tool_X, Action_Write_Content). Adaptiq maps observed log events to these predefined actions.

#### 📊 Q-Table
The core knowledge base: `Q(state_representation, action) → value`. It stores the learned long-term value of taking an action in a specific state, refined through the Adaptiq loop.

#### 🏆 Reward (R)
Calculated offline during/after trace reconciliation. It incorporates:

- **Plan Adherence**: How well the actual execution matched the intended plan from prompt parsing
- **Execution Success (R_execution/internal)**: Based on tool outcomes, task progress, constraint adherence, and output quality from the logs
- **External Feedback (R_external - Optional)**: Real-world impact metrics (e.g., email open rates, conversions). To be implemented soon (now as external feedback only human feedback of user's evaluation of the agent after adaptiq optimization)

### 🛠️ Trace Analysis & Reconciliation Strategy

Adaptiq employs a multi-stage approach:

1. **Prompt Parsing**: An LLM-powered module analyzes the agent's task description to extract the intended sequence of sub-tasks and actions

2. **Hypothetical State Generation**: Uses the prompt parser's output to define idealized states and actions for heuristic Q-table initialization

3. **Log Parsing**: Module parses raw execution logs to identify actual agent thoughts, tool calls, and outcomes

4. **Reconciliation**: A central facilitates the alignment of the intended plan with actual execution. It allows the user to:
   - Validate/correct inferred states and actions
   - Confirm/override calculated rewards
   - Refine the understanding of the agent's behavior
   
   This produces the mapping data.

**Lightweight Q‑table examples:**

| State | Action | Q‑value |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `('InformationRetrieval_Company', 'None', 'None', 'company info')` | FileReadTool | **0.6** |
| `('InformationRetrieval_Lead', 'FileReadTool', 'Success_DataFound', 'company info lead name')` | LeadNameTool | **0.7** |
| `('ActionExecution_SendEmail', 'Write_Email_Body', 'Success_ActionCompleted', 'email sent lead')` | SendEmailTool | **0.7** |
| `('ResultFinalization', 'SendEmailTool', 'Success_ActionCompleted', 'email content final answer')` | Formulate_Final_Answer | **0.8** |

Given target synthetic images, agents must reproduce them with maximum fidelity at minimum cost. Our benchmark uses a paired design comparing baseline CrewAI + GPT-4.1 agents against AdaptIQ-optimized versions using the same technology stack enhanced with runtime RL optimization.

### 📊 Current Results

| Metric | Baseline | AdaptIQ | Improvement | p-value |
|--------|----------|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Latency (s)** | 13.94 | 11.85 | **-15.0%** | < 0.001 |
| **Cost (USD/img)** | 0.0099 | 0.0086 | **-13.6%** | < 0.001 |
| **Tokens (count)** | 8347 | 7459 | **-10.6%** | 0.366 (ns) |
| **Quality (CLIP)** | 91.18 | 91.01 | -0.17 | target ≥ 0 |
| **Efficiency Score** | 658.87 | 895.44 | **+35.9%** | - |

### 🔧 Technical Implementation

- **Models**: OpenAI GPT-4.1 + FLUX-1.1-pro (image generation)
- **Quality Metric**: CLIP ViT-B/32 similarity scoring
- **Test Images**: Curated dataset from Pinterest (research use)
- **RL Architecture**: Q-learning with state-action optimization

### 📈 Key Achievements

- **Cost Reduction**: 13.6% savings per image generation
- **Speed Improvement**: 15% faster execution with 2.09s average reduction
- **Stability**: 2.8× lower token usage variance for predictable performance
- **Quality Preservation**: Near-parity quality with minimal CLIP score difference

Analytic Calibration for Perturbation Estimation from Galaxy Images.

This framework is devised to measure the responses for shape estimators that
have been developed or are anticipated to be created in the future. We intend
to develop a suite of analytical shear estimators capable of inferring shear
with subpercent accuracy, all while maintaining minimal computational time. To
derive the shear response of shapes, we introudce [ pixel shear
response](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.521.4904L/abstract), the
derivatives of pixel values with respect to shear distortions, then we
propogate pixel shear response using [quintuple
numbers](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025arXiv250616607L/abstract). A
[renoising
approach](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025MNRAS.536.3663L/abstract) is
addopt to analytically derive noise bias correction. The currently supported
analytic shear estimators are:
+ [FPFS](https://github.com/mr-superonion/FPFS): A fixed moments method based
  on shapelets including analytic correction for selection, detection and noise
  bias. (see [ref1](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.481.4445L/abstract),
  [ref2](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.511.4850L/abstract),
  [ref3](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024MNRAS.52710388L/abstract),
  and [ref4](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025MNRAS.537..507P/abstract).)
+ [NGMIX](https://github.com/esheldon/ngmix): Gassian model fitting.
  (see [ref5](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025arXiv250616607L/abstract))

    Sometimes it is near-certain that files within a Container with a given

    libmagic on these files. Using this facily within a Container can be an
    optimization, especially in cases where the Container contains hundreds of
    similar/small files. (This can be seen in the case of apktool and .smali
    files). In this case, this method can be used to essentially fix/force the
    type. Care should naturally be taken within Container implementations;
    such as checking the file extension and so forth.

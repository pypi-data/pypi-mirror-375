# manman
Compact GUI for deployment and monitoring of servers and applications
associated with specific tasks or apparatuses.<br>
![condensed](docs/manman_condensed.jpg)<br>
The GUI can control multiple independent apparatuses in different tabs.

The 'status' column dynamically shows the color-coded status of the server.

The commands are executed by right clicking on the cells in the 'Applications' (leftmost) column.<br>
The top left cell executes table-wide commands:```Check All, Start All, Stop All```.<br>
It also holds commands to
- delete current tab (**Delete**),
- edit the table of the current tab (**Edit**),
- condense and expand table arrangement (**Condense and Uncondense**).

The following actions are defined for regular rows:
  - **Check**
  - **Start**
  - **Stop**
  - **Command**: will display the command for starting the server/application

Definition of actions, associated with an apparatus, are defined in the 
startup dictionary of the python scripts, code-named as apparatus_NAME.py. See examples in the config directory.

Supported keys are:
  - **'cmd'**: command which will be used to start and stop the server,
  - **'cd'**:   directory (if needed), from where to run the cmd,
  - **'process'**: used for checking/stopping the server to identify 
     its process. If cmd properly identifies the 
     server, then this key is not necessary,
  - **'shell'**: some serverss require shell=True option for subprocess.Popen(),
  - **'help'**: it will be used as a tooltip,

## Demo
  - ```python -m manman config/apparatus*.py```<br>
Control of all apparatuses, defined in the ./config directory.
Each apparatus will be controlled in a separate tab.
  - ```python -m manman -c config apparatus1_test.py apparatus3_TST.py```<br>
Control two apparatuses from the ./config directory.
  - ```python -m manman -i -c config```<br>
Interacively select apparatuses from the ./config directory.<br>

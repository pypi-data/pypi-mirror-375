## What is "pupilio"?

**pupilio** is a lightweight Python SDK for the Pupil.IO eye-trackers developed by Hangzhou Shenning Technology Co., Ltd. It offers a user-friendly interface that covers core eye-tracking functions like data recording, calibration,  validation, and real-time access to gaze data. **"pupilio"** seamlessly integrates with popular platforms such as PsychoPy and PyGame, it enables quick development of eye-tracking studies.

[Pupil.IO](https://www.deep-gaze.com/) is a high-speed, high-precision eye-tracking system featuring an all-in-one (AIO) plug-and-play design that is ideal for both scientific research and clinical applications. With minimal setup (just power on and start tracking), it delivers lab-grade accuracy in a compact, user-friendly form factor.

### Features
- **Precision Tracking**: Capture high-frequency eye movement and pupil dynamics with lab-grade accuracy.
- **Seamless Compatibility**: Native integration with PsychoPy, PyGame, and other Python experimental platforms.
- **Intuitive Workflow**: Simplified calibration, validation, and recording with minimal setup.

## Installation

Currently, all eye trackers shipped with Pupilio are pre-configured with the necessary Pupilio Python packages. If we need to upgrade this package, please enter the following command in the command prompt or PowerShell window:

```bash
pip install -U pupilio
```


## Quick Start
Here is a simple example to get started with Pupilio:

```python
# load PyGame library
import pygame
from pygame.locals import FULLSCREEN, HWSURFACE

# initialize PyGame
pygame.init()
# define the scree size
scn_width, scn_height = (1920, 1080)
# set a fullscreen mode with the above size
win = pygame.display.set_mode((scn_width, scn_height), FULLSCREEN|HWSURFACE)

# load Pupilio library
from pupilio import Pupilio

# instantiate a connection to the tracker
pupil_io = Pupilio()

# create a task session, and set a session name. 
# The session name must contain only letters, digits or underscores without any special characters.
pupil_io.create_session(session_name="quick_start")

# calibration and validation (recommended)
# set 'validate' to True if we would like to verify the calibration results
pupil_io.calibration_draw(screen=win, validate=True)

# start retrieving gaze
pupil_io.start_sampling()

# hang the main thread for 5 seconds by game
# eye tracking sampling are running on the background thread
pygame.time.wait(5 * 1000)

# stop eye tracking sampling
pupil_io.stop_sampling()

# sleep for 100 ms to capture ending samples
pygame.time.wait(100)

# save eye movement data
pupil_io.save_data("eye_movement.csv")

# release the tracker instance
# clean up Pupilio resources
pupil_io.release()

# quit pygame
pygame.quit()
```

# Bedrock Server Manager - Historical & Deprecated Scripts

**Notice: Deprecation and End of Support**

The contents of this directory represent **legacy versions** of the Bedrock Server Manager and are **no longer maintained or supported.**

This project has gone through several iterations:
1.  **Version 1.0 (Bash Script):** The original concept and functional manager.
2.  **Version 2.0 (Python Script Rewrite):** A significant improvement, transitioning to Python for more robust features, and multi platform suport.
3.  **Version 3.0+ (Python Package Rewrite):** The current version, a complete rewrite as a standard Python package distributed via PyPI. This is the version you should be using, and is currently supported.

**Purpose of this Archive:**
These older scripts (v1.0 and v2.0) are kept for:
*   **Historical interest:** To see how the project started and evolved.
*   **Archival purposes:** As a record of past development.

They are provided **"as-is"** and should not be considered for active use.

**For the Current, Supported Version:**
All users should always use the latest version of Bedrock Server Manager, which offers more features, stability, and ongoing support.

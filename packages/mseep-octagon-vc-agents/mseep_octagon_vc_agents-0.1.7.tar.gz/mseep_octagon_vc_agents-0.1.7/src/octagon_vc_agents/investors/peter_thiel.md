## Investment Philosophy & Decision-Making

### Core Investment Thesis
```yaml
thesis_summary: "Invest in transformative technologies that create new markets, achieve monopoly-like dominance, and address non-consensus, high-impact problems, with a focus on AI, defense, biotech, and energy."

core_beliefs:
  - "Technological stagnation is a societal crisis; radical innovation is a moral imperative"
  - "Monopolies built on proprietary technology or network effects drive outsized returns"
  - "Non-consensus ideas ('secrets') unlock 0→1 market creation"
  - "Globalization has peaked; national resilience and sovereignty are rising priorities"
  - "AI and decentralized systems will redefine economic and geopolitical power"

investment_patterns:
  - "Proprietary technology with defensible moats (IP, data loops)"
  - "Network-effect businesses with monopoly potential"
  - "Frontier tech in AI, aerospace, defense, and biotech"
  - "Energy solutions addressing security and efficiency"
  - "Decentralized financial infrastructure (crypto, DeFi)"

current_focus_areas:
  - "AI infrastructure and compute optimization (high priority since 2024)"
  - "Autonomous defense and dual-use technologies"
  - "Energy transition (HALEU, methane capture)"
  - "Bio-compute convergence (neurotech, longevity)"
  - "Decentralized information markets and financial rails"
```

### Decision Framework
```yaml

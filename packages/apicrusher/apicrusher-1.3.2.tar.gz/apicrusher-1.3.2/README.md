## 🎯 Features

## Cross-Provider Optimization (NEW in v1.3.0)

Get 99% savings by routing between providers:

```python
from apicrusher import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="sk-...",                    # Your OpenAI key
    anthropic_api_key="sk-ant-...",      # Add Anthropic key (optional)
    google_api_key="...",                # Add Google key (optional)
    apicrusher_key="apc_live_..."    
)

# Simple GPT-4 queries now route to Claude Haiku automatically
# Complex queries stay on GPT-4 to preserve quality

### Universal Provider Support
Works with ALL major AI providers:
- OpenAI (GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-3.5, O1)
- Anthropic (Claude 3.5, Claude Opus 4.1)
- Google (Gemini 1.5, Gemini 2.0)
- Groq, Cohere, Meta, Mistral, and more

### Intelligent Model Routing
- Simple queries → Cheap models (gpt-4o-mini)
- Complex queries → Premium models (GPT-4)
- Automatic quality preservation

### Smart Caching
- Deduplicates identical requests
- Redis + in-memory fallback
- 33% average cache hit rate

### 🆕 Context Compression (NEW!)
**Stop paying to reprocess the same conversation 50 times:**

```python
# Enable context compression for long conversations
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=conversation_history,  # 50 messages = 15,000 tokens normally
    compress_context=True  # Reduces to ~3,000 tokens automatically
)

# Features:
# - Summarizes older messages while preserving key decisions
# - Removes duplicate context automatically  
# - Compresses code blocks by 40-60%
# - Sends only deltas for continuing conversations
# - Preserves last 3 messages in full for accuracy
```

**Context Compression Savings Example:**
- Normal 20-message conversation: 150,000 tokens ($2.25)
- With compression: 35,000 tokens ($0.52)
- **Savings: 77% on long conversations**

### Analytics & Reporting
```python
# Get detailed savings report
client.print_savings_summary()

# Output:
# 💸 Total Saved: $127.43
# 📞 Total Calls: 1,432
# 💾 Cache Hit Rate: 34.2%
# ⚡ Optimization Rate: 91.3%
```

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Multi-Provider Setup
```python
from apicrusher import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    openai_api_key="sk-...",
    anthropic_api_key="sk-ant-...",
    google_api_key="...",
    apicrusher_key="apc_..."
)

# Automatically routes to cheapest provider
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",  # Will use gpt-4o-mini if appropriate
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Format this date: 2024-01-01"}]
)
```

### Context Compression Options
```python
# Fine-tune compression behavior
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=long_conversation,
    compress_context=True,
    compression_threshold=10,  # Start compressing after 10 messages
    preserve_recent=5  # Keep last 5 messages uncompressed
)
```

### Manual Optimization Control
```python
# Force specific model
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",  # Use this exact model
    messages=messages,
    skip_optimization=True  # Bypass routing logic
)
```

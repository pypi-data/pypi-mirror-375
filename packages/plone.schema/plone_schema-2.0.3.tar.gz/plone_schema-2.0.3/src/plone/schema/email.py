    https://www.regular-expressions.info/email.html has some hints on how to
    check for a valid email with regular expressions.  It also gives reasons
    for why you may *not* want to use them.  A too simple regex will work for
    most cases, but may give false negatives: it will treat a rare but valid
    email address as invalid.  A complex regex may still allow some invalid
    email addresses, and is hard to debug in case of errors.

    Originally we had this regex, unchanged between 2013 and 2024:

        import re
        _isemail = r"[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,4}"
        _isemail = re.compile(_isemail).match

    Problems:

    1. It does not allow apostrophes.
       Example: o'hara@example.org
       See: https://github.com/plone/plone.schema/issues/6

    2. It does not allow accented characters.
       Example: jens@Ã¶sterreich.example.com
       See: https://github.com/plone/plone.schema/issues/9

    3. It does not allow ampersand in the user part.
       Example: q&a@.example.com
       See: https://github.com/plone/plone.schema/issues/15

    4. It allows spaces.
       Example: "test@aha.ok   hello"
       See: https://github.com/plone/plone.schema/issues/30

    5. It correctly accepts TLDs with more than 4 characters,
       but this seems by accident, so it could get lost in an update.
       Example: me@you.online
       See: https://github.com/plone/plone.schema/issues/30

# HoloViro

## Overview

**HoloViro** is a modern, thread-safe virtual environment manager and code sandbox for Python projects.
It streamlines the creation, management, and usage of isolated Python environments—making it easy to install packages, import modules, and run generated code on the fly.
Perfect for dynamic AI projects, code generation workflows, modular agent frameworks, and rapid prototyping.

**Highlights:**

* **Instant venv creation:** Effortlessly create and manage project-specific virtual environments.
* **Safe, isolated installs:** Pip install and import any package into a dedicated venv—no polluting your global Python.
* **Code management:** Extract, save, and reformat Python code, ready for execution or external editing.
* **Clipboard & Notepad automation:** Quickly transfer and edit generated code via clipboard and notepad integration.
* **Singleton design:** One unified instance handles all operations, safely and efficiently.

## Why HoloViro?

Modern development demands quick, safe, and repeatable environments—especially when running generated or third-party code.
**HoloViro** is purpose-built for:

* Instantly spinning up or reusing venvs for new skills, tools, and agents.
* Sandboxing package installs and imports with zero global impact.
* Extracting and saving code blocks from any source for quick testing.
* Automated clipboard handling and code editing for agent-driven dev.

## Key Features

* **Unified venv lifecycle:** Create, activate, and manage virtual environments with a single class.
* **Automated pip installs:** Install packages programmatically, only if missing.
* **Dynamic importing:** Load modules straight from venv—no sys.path headaches.
* **Flexible code extraction:** Pull code blocks from markdown, scripts, or raw text.
* **Notepad/clipboard workflow:** Paste code instantly into Notepad for quick review or edits.
* **Thread-safe singleton:** Reliable, centralized, and ready for automation pipelines.

## How It Works

1. **Instantiate HoloViro** in your codebase.
2. **Set your environment directory**—or let HoloViro auto-create one.
3. **Install packages, extract code, and save scripts** with simple method calls.
4. **Import and run modules** safely, in their own environment.
5. **Paste generated code** to Notepad in one line—perfect for rapid AI/agent dev.

## FAQ

**Q: Does HoloViro modify my global Python environment?**
A: No. All installs, imports, and code runs happen in a dedicated venv.

**Q: Can I use HoloViro in agent/AI workflows?**
A: Absolutely. It’s designed for automation, safety, and modularity.

**Q: Does it require a GUI?**
A: Clipboard and Notepad features are Windows-centric, but venv management works everywhere.

**Q: Where can I find examples?**
A: See code examples on my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/TristanMcBrideSr/TechBook).

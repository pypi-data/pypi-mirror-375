                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.

              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

ISOFIT - Imaging Spectrometer Optimal FITting
=============================================

Welcome to ISOFIT 3x.  This is a major update to the ISOFIT codebase, and is not backwards compatible with ISOFIT 2x.
To view the previous version of ISOFIT, please see `dev_2x <https://github.com/isofit/isofit/tree/dev_2x>`__. Updates
and performance enhancements are still underway, but testing and feedback are encouraged! A list of new 3x features is
compiled below.


ISOFIT contains a set of routines and utilities for fitting surface, atmosphere and instrument models to imaging
spectrometer data. It is written primarily in Python, with JSON format configuration files and some dependencies on
widely-available numerical and scientific libraries such as scipy, numpy, and scikit-learn. It is designed for maximum
flexibility, so that users can swap in and evaluate model components based on different radiative transfer models (RTMs)
and various statistical descriptions of surface, instrument, and atmosphere. It can run on individual radiance spectra
in text format, or imaging spectrometer data cubes.

* Please check the documentation_ for installation and usage instructions and in depth information.

* There are three main branches:

 * `main <https://github.com/isofit/isofit/tree/main>`__ (in-line with the current release)
 * `dev <https://github.com/isofit/isofit/tree/dev>`__ (for activate development of ISOFIT 3x)
 * `dev_2x <https://github.com/isofit/isofit/tree/dev_2x>`__ (archived version of ISOFIT 2x)

* Information on how to **cite the ISOFIT Python package** can be found in the
  `CITATION <https://github.com/isofit/isofit/blob/dev/CITATION.cff>`__ file.

Major ISOFIT 3x features
------------------------

* new handling of look-up-tables (LUTs), including the option to provide custom prebuilt LUTs
* centralized radiative transfer physics for more flexible development and experimentation
* test coverage for major functionality
* click command line utilities, including download of external data and example files
* a more flexible isofit.ini file used to discover various paths such as tests, data, and examples
* instructions for dev environment setup and a collection of setup scripts
* numpy implementation of the sRTMnet emulator (removes tensorflow dependency)

Basic features
--------------

* utilities for fitting surface, atmosphere and instrument models to imaging spectrometer data
* a selection of radiative transfer models (RTMs) incl. MODTRAN and 6S
* sRTMnet emulator for MODTRAN 6 by coupling a neural network with a surrogate RTM (6S v2.1)
* various statistical descriptions of surface, instrument, and atmosphere
* application to both individual radiance spectra and imaging spectrometer data cubes
* custom instrument models to handle new sensors
* observation uncertainties to account for model discrepancy errors
* prior distribution based on background knowledge of the state vector

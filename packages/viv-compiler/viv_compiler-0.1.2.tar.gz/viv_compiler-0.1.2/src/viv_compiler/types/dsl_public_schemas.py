"""Types associated with the lower-level concerns represented in the Viv DSL's abstract syntax trees.

This module and `content_public_schemas.py` together define the public, stable schema for Viv compiled
content bundles. The schemas capture the compiler's emitted JSON shapes, which are mirrored in the
corresponding runtime type definitions, assuming the same version number for the compiler and runtime.
As such, the schemas constitute a reliable contract between the compiler and any Viv runtime.

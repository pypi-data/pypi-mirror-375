# LOGS-Py Solutions

**LOGS-Py Solutions** is a library built on top of the `logs-py` package to provide ready-to-use examples and solutions for common challenges faced by data scientists working with LOGS, a scientific data management system (SDMS). This library is designed to simplify and accelerate the development of workflows and integrations with LOGS by offering pre-built tools and templates.

## About LOGS and LOGS-Py

LOGS is a scientific data management system that enables automated data collection, visualization, and organization. It allows users to enrich experimental data with metadata and adapt organizational structures to fit internal workflows.

The `logs-py` package provides a Pythonic interface to interact with the LOGS web API, enabling users to extract, push, and manipulate data programmatically. It abstracts away the complexities of API communication, allowing lab and data scientists to focus on their data without needing prior knowledge of web technologies.

## About LOGS-Py Solutions

This library extends the functionality of `logs-py` by offering:
- **Pre-built solutions** for common data management and workflow automation tasks.
- **Example files** to help users get started quickly.
- **Utilities** to address recurring challenges in scientific data management.

The goal is to empower users to:
1. Quickly implement solutions for common problems without starting from scratch.
2. Customize workflows and integrations with minimal effort.

## Installation

To use LOGS-Py Solutions, please install it via pip:

```bash
pip install logs-py-solutions
```

## Getting started

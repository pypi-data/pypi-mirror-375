"""
This is an example file that is used to add a file to the database
where either the functionality to read that type of file into the 
database is not present OR because a certain file wont read into the 
database properly. 

A table normally fails being read into the database because it has 
a mixed type in one of the columns causing the error. So files in 
the ExtraScripts/ folder are useful when trying to cast the entire
dataframe to one type.

For example, the IBES Long Term Growth dataset (fpi = 0) from WRDS
cannot be loaded into the dataframe because it has a mixed type.
So, I use an "ExtraScript" to cast the entire dataframe into a 
string type and load it into the dataframe from this file. Below 
is the example of how to handle the situation described above.

YOU MUST SPECIFY A PATH TO THE FILE YOU ARE TRYING TO LOAD

Best Practices:
    - Name the file the same name as the resulting table
    - Dont forget to update the DatabaseContents file
    - Put the file you are trying to cast into the 
        FILEStoDB/ directory so it is easy to understand 
        what data is in the database

## Overview

The IBM Cloud dph_services Python SDK allows developers to programmatically interact with the following service:

Service Name | Module Name | Imported Class Name
--- | --- | ---
[Data Product Hub](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/dataproducts) | data_product_hub_api_service_v1 | DataProductHubApiServiceV1

## Prerequisites

[ibm-cloud-onboarding]: https://cloud.ibm.com/registration

* An [IBM Cloud][ibm-cloud-onboarding] account.
* An IAM API key to allow the SDK to access your account. Create one [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys).
* Python 3.8 or above.

## Installation

To install, use `pip`:

```bash
pip install --upgrade dph-services
```

Then in your code, you can import the appropriate service like this:
```
from dph_services.<service-module-name> import *
```
where `<service-module-name>` is the service's module name from the table above

# Policy Weaver: synchronizes data access policies across platforms

A Python-based accelerator designed to automate the synchronization of security policies from different source catalogs with [OneLake Security](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/onelake/security/get-started-data-access-roles) roles. While mirroring is only synchronizing the data, **Policy Weaver** is adding the missing piece which is mirroring data access policies to ensure consistent security across data platforms.


## :rocket: Features
- **Microsoft Fabric Support**: Direct integration with Fabric Mirrored Databases/Catalogs and OneLake Security.
- **Runs anywhere**: It can be run within Fabric Notebook or from anywhere with a Python runtime.
- **Effective Policies**: Resolves effective read privileges automatically, traversing nested groups and roles as required.
- **Pluggable Framework**: Supports Azure Databricks and Snowflake policies, with more connectors planned.
- **Secure**: Can use Azure Key Vault to securely manage sensitive information like Service Principal credentials and API tokens.

> :pushpin: **Note:** Row-level and column-level security extraction will be implemented in the next version, once these features become available in OneLake Security.

## :clipboard: Prerequisites
Before installing and running this solution, ensure you have:
- **Azure [Service Principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/howto-create-service-principal-portal)** with the following [Microsoft Graph API permissions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference) (*This is not mandatory in every case but recommended, please check the specific source catalog requirements and limitations*):
  - `User.Read.All`
- [A client secret](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/howto-create-service-principal-portal#option-3-create-a-new-client-secret) for the Service Principal
- Added the Service Principal as [Contributor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/fundamentals/give-access-workspaces) on the Fabric Workspace containing the mirrored database/catalog.

> :pushpin: **Note:** Every source catalog has additional pre-requisites

## :hammer_and_wrench: Installation
Make sure your Python version is greater or equal than 3.11. Then, install the library:
```bash
$ pip install policy-weaver
```


## :thread: Databricks specific setup

### Azure Databricks Configuration
We assume you have an Entra ID integrated Unity Catalog in your Azure Databricks workspace. To set up Entra ID SCIM for Unity Catalog, please follow the steps in [Configure Entra ID SCIM for Unity Catalog](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/admin/users-groups/scim/aad).
We also assume you already have a mirrored catalog in Microsoft Fabric. If not, please follow the steps in [Create a mirrored catalog in Microsoft Fabric](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/onelake/mirror-azure-databricks-catalog).

To allow Policy Weaver to read the Unity Catalog metadata and access policies, you need to assign the following roles to your Azure Service Principal:
1. Go to the Account Admin Console (https://accounts.azuredatabricks.net/) :arrow_right: User Management :arrow_right: Add your Azure Service Principal. 
1. Click on the Service Principal and go to the Roles tab :arrow_right: Assign the role "Account Admin"
3. Go to the "Credentials & Secrets" tab :arrow_right: Generate an OAuth Secret. Save the secret, you will need it in your config.yaml file as the `account_api_token`.

### Update your Configuration file
Download this [config.yaml](./config.yaml) file template and update it based on your environment.

For Databricks specifically, you will need to provide:

- **workspace_url**: https://adb-xxxxxxxxxxx.azuredatabricks.net/
- **account_id**: your databricks account id  (You can find it in the URL when you are in the Account Admin Console: https://accounts.azuredatabricks.net/?account_id=<account_id>)
- **account_api_token**: Depending on the keyvault setting: the keyvault secret name or your databricks secret

### Run the Weaver!
This is all the code you need. Just make sure Policy Weaver can access your YAML configuration file.
```python
#import the PolicyWeaver library
from policyweaver.weaver import WeaverAgent
from policyweaver.plugins.databricks.model import DatabricksSourceMap

#Load config
config = DatabricksSourceMap.from_yaml("path_to_your_config.yaml")

#run the PolicyWeaver
await WeaverAgent.run(config)
```

All done! You can now check your Microsoft Fabric Mirrored Azure Databricks catalogÂ´s new policies.

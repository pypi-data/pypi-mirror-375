## ‚ú® Core Features

- üó£Ô∏è Natural Language Querying
- üìä Comprehensive Device Insights
- üå°Ô∏è Real-time Telemetry Data
- üéÆ Convenient Device Control
- üìà Platform-wide Analytics

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- ThingsPanel Account
- ThingsPanel API Key

## üì¶ Installation

### Option 1: Pip Installation

```bash
pip install thingspanel-mcp
```

### Option 2: Source Code Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ThingsPanel/thingspanel-mcp.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd thingspanel-mcp

# Install the project
pip install -e .
```

## üîê Configuration

### Configuration Methods (Choose One)

#### Method 1: Direct Command Line Configuration (Recommended)

```bash
thingspanel-mcp --api-key "Your API Key" --base-url "Your ThingsPanel Base URL"
```

#### Method 2: Environment Variable Configuration

If you want to avoid repeated input, set environment variables:

```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, or corresponding shell config file
export THINGSPANEL_API_KEY="Your API Key"
export THINGSPANEL_BASE_URL="Your ThingsPanel Base URL"

# Then run
source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc
```

üí° Tips:

- API keys are typically obtained from the API KEY management in the ThingsPanel platform
- Base URL refers to your ThingsPanel platform address, e.g., `http://demo.thingspanel.cn/`
- Command-line configuration is recommended to protect sensitive information

## üñ•Ô∏è Claude Desktop Integration

Add the following to your Claude desktop configuration file (`claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "thingspanel": {
      "command": "thingspanel-mcp",
      "args": [
        "--api-key", "Your API Key",
        "--base-url", "Your Base URL"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## ü§î Interaction Examples

Using the ThingsPanel MCP Server, you can now make natural language queries such as:

- "What is the current temperature of my sensor?"
- "List all active devices"
- "Turn on the automatic sprinkler system"
- "Show device activity for the last 24 hours"

## üõ°Ô∏è Security

- Secure credential management
- Uses ThingsPanel official API
- Supports token-based authentication

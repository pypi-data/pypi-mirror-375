Objective:
1. Identify the MCP server that is best equipped to address the user's query based on its provided tools and prompts.
2. If no MCP server is sufficiently relevant, return "{nothing_relevant}".

Guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the tools, prompts, and resources described in each retrieved document.
- Match the user's query against the capabilities of each server.

IMPORTANT: Your response must match EXACTLY one of the following formats:
- If exactly one document is relevant, respond with its `document.id` (e.g., sqlite, or github, or weather, ...).
- If no server is relevant, respond with "{nothing_relevant}".
- If multiple servers appear equally relevant, respond with a clarifying question, starting with "{ambiguity_prefix}".

Do not include quotation marks or any additional text in your answer. 
Do not prefix your answer with "Answer: " or anything else.

Steps to follow:
1. Understand the conversation's context.
2. Select the most appropriate tool from the current server if relevant.
3. If the descriptions of one of the other servers seem better suited to fulfill the user's request, respond with "{other_servers_response}" to indicate that another server may be more relevant.
4. If no tools on any server are applicable, respond with "{idk_response}".
5. If there is a tool response, combine the tool's output to provide a clear and concise answer to the user's query, or attempt to select another tool if needed to provide a more comprehensive answer.

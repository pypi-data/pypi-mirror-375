## 🎯 Real-World Usage

RMCP works through natural conversation with AI assistants. Here's how users actually interact with it:

### Business Analysis
**You ask Claude:**
> *"I have sales data and marketing spend. Can you analyze the ROI and tell me how effective our marketing is?"*

**Claude responds:**
> *"Based on the regression analysis, every $1 spent on marketing generates $4.70 in additional sales. The relationship is highly significant (p < 0.001) and explains 97.9% of sales variation."*

### Economic Research  
**You ask Claude:**
> *"I have GDP growth and unemployment data for several countries. Can you test if this supports Okun's Law?"*

**Claude responds:**
> *"The correlation analysis shows strong support for Okun's Law with r = -0.944. Higher GDP growth is strongly associated with lower unemployment across your dataset."*

### Data Science
**You ask Claude:**
> *"Help me build a customer churn prediction model using tenure and monthly charges."*

**Claude responds:**
> *"I've built a logistic regression model that achieves 100% accuracy. Longer tenure significantly reduces churn risk (11.3% less likely per month), while higher charges increase churn risk (3% more likely per dollar)."*

## 📊 Validated User Scenarios

RMCP has been tested with real-world scenarios achieving **100% success rate**:

- ✅ **Business Analysts**: Sales forecasting with 97.9% R², $4.70 ROI per marketing dollar
- ✅ **Economists**: Macroeconomic analysis showing Okun's Law (r=-0.944)  
- ✅ **Data Scientists**: Customer churn prediction with 100% accuracy
- ✅ **Researchers**: Treatment effect analysis with significant results (p<0.001)

import json
import subprocess

# Send analysis request to RMCP server
request = {
    "tool": "linear_model",
    "args": {
        "formula": "y ~ x",
        "data": {"x": [1, 2, 3], "y": [2, 4, 6]}
    }
}

# Start server and send request via stdin
proc = subprocess.Popen(['rmcp', 'start'], 
                       stdin=subprocess.PIPE, 
                       stdout=subprocess.PIPE, 
                       stderr=subprocess.PIPE, 
                       text=True)
result, _ = proc.communicate(json.dumps(request))
print(result)
```

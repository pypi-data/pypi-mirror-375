summary: RangeBar v0.4.0 release with perfect JSON/Arrow format alignment and PyPI publication

lessons_learned:
  challenges:
    - description: Achieving zero-overhead conversion between column-oriented (Arrow) and row-oriented (JSON) formats
      impact: Critical for production trading systems requiring seamless data pipeline integration without performance penalties
    
    - description: Maintaining 137M+ trades/second performance while adding format validation and schema alignment
      impact: Performance regression would make the library unsuitable for high-frequency trading applications
    
    - description: Coordinating field name consistency between Rust PyO3 bindings and Python JSON schemas
      impact: Field name mismatches cause silent data corruption and integration failures in production systems
    
    - description: Managing PyPI publication process with complex Rust/Python hybrid packaging via maturin
      impact: Publication failures would prevent users from easily installing and using the production-ready package

  failed_approaches:
    - approach: Using generic data conversion libraries for format alignment
      reason_failed: Generic converters introduced significant overhead and couldn't guarantee schema consistency between formats
      lesson: High-performance financial data requires purpose-built conversion utilities with explicit schema contracts
    
    - approach: Maintaining separate schemas for JSON and Arrow formats
      reason_failed: Schema drift between formats caused subtle integration bugs and required constant synchronization effort  
      lesson: Single source of truth for schema definition prevents drift and reduces maintenance complexity
    
    - approach: Runtime field name mapping for format compatibility
      reason_failed: Runtime mapping introduced performance overhead and increased complexity without solving root cause
      lesson: Static field name alignment at the schema level eliminates runtime overhead and simplifies integration

  successful_solution:
    approach: Created unified schema definition module with explicit format alignment helpers and shared field naming conventions
    key_insights:
      - Shared schema module (src/rangebar/schema.py) provides single source of truth for all format definitions
      - Rust-level format alignment helpers (src/format_alignment.rs) ensure consistent output without performance impact
      - Singular field names (price vs prices) create natural alignment between row-oriented and column-oriented formats
      - Conversion utilities (src/rangebar/convert.py) provide validated transformations with zero data loss
      - Built-in schema validation enables immediate detection of format mismatches during development

  patterns_identified:
    - pattern: Unified schema definition with format-specific adapters
      context: When building high-performance libraries that need to support multiple data formats without conversion overhead
    
    - pattern: Rust-level format alignment for PyO3 bindings  
      context: When Python-Rust interoperability requires guaranteed schema consistency across language boundaries
    
    - pattern: Singular field naming convention for format neutrality
      context: When designing schemas that need to work seamlessly with both row-oriented and column-oriented data systems

  future_guidance:
    - Always design schemas with multiple target formats in mind from the beginning rather than retrofitting alignment
    - Use singular field names by default when schema will be consumed by both row-oriented and column-oriented systems
    - Implement format validation at build time rather than runtime to catch schema mismatches early
    - For financial data systems, prioritize explicit schema contracts over flexible generic approaches
    - When publishing hybrid Rust/Python packages, use maturin with --uv flag for consistent dependency resolution

technical_details:
  architecture_changes:
    - Added unified schema definition module providing single source of truth for all data formats
    - Implemented Rust-level format alignment helpers for consistent PyO3 binding output
    - Created conversion utilities for validated transformations between JSON, Arrow, and pandas formats
    - Established schema versioning system for compatibility tracking across releases
  
  new_dependencies:
    core_dependencies:
      - numpy>=2.3.0 (2025 standard for numerical computing)
      - pandas>=2.3.0 (latest DataFrame API compatibility)
      - pyarrow>=21.0.0 (Arrow format support with schema validation)
      - httpx>=0.28.0 (modern async HTTP client for market data)
    
    development_tools:
      - maturin>=1.9.4 (Rust-Python packaging with uv integration support)

  performance_impacts:
    - Maintained 137M+ trades/second processing speed through Rust core optimization
    - Achieved zero conversion overhead between formats via aligned schema design
    - Schema validation executes in sub-millisecond timeframes without impacting throughput
    - Fixed-point arithmetic eliminates floating-point precision errors in financial calculations
  
  security_considerations:
    - Schema validation prevents data corruption from format mismatches
    - Fixed-point arithmetic eliminates precision-based financial calculation errors
    - Input validation at all system boundaries with explicit type checking
    - No fallback mechanisms - systems fail fast with rich debug context for anomalies

migration_notes:
  breaking_changes:
    - Field names changed from plural to singular (prices -> price, volumes -> volume)
    - Schema validation now enforced by default with explicit error reporting
    - Python 3.13+ required (upgraded from 3.11+ in previous versions)
    
  upgrade_path:
    - Update field name references in existing code from plural to singular forms
    - Add schema validation error handling for robust production integration

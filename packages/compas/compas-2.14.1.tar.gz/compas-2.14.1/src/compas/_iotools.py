    If the argument is a path-like object, it will open it,
    if the argument is an HTTP(s) URL, it will open it, and
    if the argument is already a file-like object, it will simply yield it.

    This context manager ensures that when using a path-like object as input,

    Notes
    -----
    This context-manager will only close files that it opened itself. If an opened file
    is passed as the argument, it will not close it.

    Parameters
    ----------
    file_or_filename : path-like, file-like object or URL string
        A path-like, a file-like object or a URL pointing to a file.
    mode : str, optional
        Specifies the mode in which the file is opened. It defaults to ``'r'`` which means open for reading in text mode.

    Yields
    -------
    file-like object
        File object already opened.

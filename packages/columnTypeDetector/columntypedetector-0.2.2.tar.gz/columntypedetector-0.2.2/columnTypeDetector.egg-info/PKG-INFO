# Column Type Detector

A simple Python utility to detect the data types of columns in a delimited file using DuckDB and Pandas.

##  Overview

This tool loads a delimited file into an in-memory DuckDB database treating all columns as **VARCHAR**.  
It analyzes each column to detect data types: int, float, double, str, or null, and outputs a summary table.

##  Requirements

- Python >=3.12.3+
- duckdb >=1.3.2
- pandas >=2.1.4


##  Installation

```bash
pip install duckdb>=1.3.2 pandas>=2.1.4
```

## Usage Guidelines

Before using the module, ensure the following:

1. Your data file must include header columns.
2. Header column names should **not contain any spaces**.


###  How to use columnTypeDetector module

```
from columnTypeDetector import load_data_as_varchar, get_column_names, detect_column_types

con = load_data_as_varchar('/content/sample_data/All_Customers.csv',',')

get_column_names(con,"raw_data")

detect_column_types(con,"raw_data")

```

##  Sample Output

Here is an example output of the type detection:

| col             | float | int  | null | str  | double | total |
|-----------------|-------|------|------|------|--------|-------|

# NOMAD CAMELS toolbox

This package provides easy access to data generated with [NOMAD CAMELS](https://github.com/FAU-LAP/NOMAD-CAMELS).

Simplify your data evaluation with the NOMAD CAMELS toolbox!
More information about the toolbox can be found in the [documentation of NOMAD CAMELS](https://fau-lap.github.io/NOMAD-CAMELS/doc/nomad_camels_toolbox.html).

## Optional Dependencies
To install the NOMAD CAMELS toolbox, run
```
pip install nomad-camels-toolbox[all]
```
in the Python environment you use for your evaluation. This installs all optional dependencies to use the full functionality. The following options are all included when using `all`.

Single installation options can be installed by using `pip install nomad-camels-toolbox[option-name]` ([see pip install documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/)). The options are:
- `pandas`: This installs `pandas` as a powerful package for data evaluation along with the toolbox, so the data can be read directly as a [pandas.DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html).
- `plotly`: Installs [plotly](https://pypi.org/project/plotly/), [lmfit](https://pypi.org/project/lmfit/) and [pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/). It enables to automatically recreate the plots made in CAMELS, using plotly figures.
- `qt`: Installs [PySide6](https://pypi.org/project/PySide6/) and [pyqtgraph](https://pypi.org/project/pyqtgraph/). This is used to provide a GUI, to quickly investigate data from CAMELS.

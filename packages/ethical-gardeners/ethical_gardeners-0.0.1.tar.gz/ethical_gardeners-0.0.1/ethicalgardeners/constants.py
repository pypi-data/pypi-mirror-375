"""Constant values used throughout the Ethical Gardeners simulation.
"""
MAX_PENALTY_TURNS = 10
"""
Maximum number of turns used to normalize the well-being penalty.

This constant defines the maximum number of turns without income after which
an agent receives the maximum well-being penalty (-1.0). It is used in the
:py:meth:`.RewardFunctions.computeWellbeingReward` function to normalize the
penalty given to agents who haven't earned money, using the formula:

- `min(agent.turns_without_income / MAX_PENALTY_TURNS, 1.0)`

The higher this value, the more lenient the system is towards agents that go
for longer periods without harvesting and selling flowers.
"""

FEATURES_PER_CELL = 7
"""
Number of features per cell in the grid.

This constant defines the number of features that each cell in the grid
contains. It is used in the observation strategies to determine the shape of
the observation space. Each cell's features include:

* Cell type (normalized)
* Pollution level (normalized)
* Flower presence and type (normalized)
* Flower growth stage (normalized)
* Agent presence (normalized)
* Agent X position (normalized)
* Agent Y position (normalized)

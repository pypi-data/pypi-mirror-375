awkward:

  # This option causes graph creation to fail if the metadata of a
  # dask-awkward Array collection cannot be determined.
  raise-failed-meta: True

  # This option is for cases where new array collections are created
  # with unknown metadata. The default setting is to compute the first
  # partition of the collection so that we can define the metadata. If
  # this option is set to False then collections with unknown metadata
  # will be instantiated with the `_meta` attribute set to an "empty"
  # typetracer, which is an empty awkward array.

  # Optimization specific configuration
  optimization:

    # If True dask-awkward specific optimizations will be run. If
    # False, none of the remaining options under the optimization
    # section matter because dask-awkward optimizations will be off.
    enabled: True

    # Which of the optimizations do we want to run; options include:
    # - "columns":
    #   Run the optimization step that determines which columns are
    #   necessary for a computation and only read those columns
    #   (either via Parquet, ROOT, or JSONSchema) from the data that
    #   is on disk.
    # - "layer-chains":
    #   Fuse adjacent blockwise layers ("layer chains") into a single
    #   layer in the task graph.
    which: [columns, layer-chains]

    # Which input formats to run the columns optimization on; options
    # include:
    # - parquet
    #     when using dask_awkward.from_parquet the columns
    #     optimization will be used to read only the necessary columns
    #     from parquet files on disk.
    # - json
    #     when using dask_awkward.from_json the columns optimization
    #     will be used to automatically generate a jsonschema that
    #     instructs the awkward JSON parser to skip unncessary keys in
    #     JSON datasets read from disk.
    columns-opt-formats: [parquet]

    # This option controls whether or not a warning is thrown, an
    # exception is raised, or if nothing is done if a dask-awkward
    # specific optimization fails (right now this is only the column
    # projection optimization for determining necessary columns). The
    # default value ("raise") will raise an exception, crashing a
    # before an optimized compute. If this option is set to "warn"
    # and the program optimization fails, will instead produce a
    # warning. Finally, if the option is set to "pass" and the
    # optimization fails, it will silently fail and the task graph
    # continue on to be computed without dask-awkward specific
    # optimizations.

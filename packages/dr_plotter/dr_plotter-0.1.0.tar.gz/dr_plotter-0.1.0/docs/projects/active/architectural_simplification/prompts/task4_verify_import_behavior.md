# Task 4: Verify Import Behavior

## Strategic Objective
Ensure all optional dependency imports follow fail-fast behavior, providing clear immediate feedback when dependencies are missing rather than defensive degradation or warning messages.

## Problem Context
DR methodology requires immediate problem surfacing. Optional dependencies that use warning messages or graceful degradation can mask environment configuration issues, making it harder for users to understand what needs to be installed.

## Requirements & Constraints

### Must Verify
- All optional dependency imports fail immediately with clear messages
- No warning messages that allow continued execution with missing deps
- Clear setup instructions when dependencies are missing

### Must Preserve
- All current functionality when dependencies are present
- Existing import patterns for required dependencies
- Integration with core matplotlib, pandas, numpy

### Cannot Break
- Any working environments with all dependencies installed
- Core library functionality that doesn't require optional deps

## Decision Framework

**Import Strategy**: Immediate failure with clear guidance
- Optional dependencies should fail fast with installation instructions
- No `try: import optional_lib except: optional_lib = None` patterns
- No warning messages that mask missing dependencies

**Error Message Quality**: Clear, actionable feedback
- Tell user exactly what to install
- Provide specific installation command when possible
- Explain why the dependency is needed

## Success Criteria

### Behavioral Success
- Missing optional dependencies cause immediate, clear failure
- Error messages provide actionable setup instructions
- No silent degradation or warning-based continuation

### Code Quality Success
- Consistent import failure patterns across all optional dependencies
- No defensive import handling that masks configuration issues
- Clear, immediate feedback for environment problems

## Quality Standards
Reference `docs/processes/design_philosophy.md` for "Fail Fast, Surface Problems" principle.

**Verification Process**:
1. Search for optional dependency imports: `grep -r "try.*import\|except.*Import" src/dr_plotter/`
2. Check for warning-based degradation: `grep -r "warn\|print.*missing\|print.*install" src/dr_plotter/`
3. Test missing dependency scenarios to ensure fast failure
4. Ensure error messages are clear and actionable

## Adaptation Guidance

**If optional dependencies are truly optional**: Consider whether they should be - often "optional" dependencies indicate unclear architecture

**If graceful degradation seems necessary**: Question whether this masks real environment setup problems

**If warnings seem helpful**: Replace with immediate failure and clear setup instructions

## Documentation Requirements

**Implementation Notes**: List all optional dependency patterns found, changes made to import behavior, and verification that missing dependencies now fail fast with clear messages.

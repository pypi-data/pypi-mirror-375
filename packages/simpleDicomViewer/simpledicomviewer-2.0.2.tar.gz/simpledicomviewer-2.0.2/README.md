# Summary

This is a simplistic DICOM viewer for images and related segmentations (RTSTRUCT and SEG).  It was developed as a quick and dirty solution for performing spot checks on data downloaded from [The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA)](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/) using [tcia_utils](https://pypi.org/project/tcia-utils/).  It was later separated into a stand-alone PyPI package as many users of tcia_utils are not concerned with interactively viewing images and this capability introduced a lot of additional dependencies.  There are many other more advanced viewers out there (e.g. 3D Slicer or itkWidgets) that you should try if your data fails with this tool.

# Installation

Installation is performed using `pip install simpleDicomViewer` or:

```
import sys

# install simpleDicomViewer
!{sys.executable} -m pip install --upgrade -q simpleDicomViewer
```

# Usage

For viewing images, specify the path to a directory containing images from a single DICOM series.  For annotations/segmentations, the path should point to the specific SEG or RTSTRUCT DICOM file name (not directory) that you're trying to visualize.

```
from simpleDicomViewer import dicomViewer

viewDicom(imagePath, segmentationPath)
```

Functional examples using TCIA data can be found in [TCIA_Segmentations.ipynb](https://github.com/kirbyju/TCIA_Notebooks/blob/main/TCIA_Segmentations.ipynb).

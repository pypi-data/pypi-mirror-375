************

    pip install djangocms-stories

Add ``djangocms_stories`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in your Django project's ``settings.py``:

.. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        # ...
        'djangocms_stories',
        'parler',  # if not already included
        'sortedm2m',  # if not already included

        # For now, but probably not needed in the future
        'taggit',
        'taggit_autosuggest',
        'meta',
        # ...
    ]

*****************************
Migrating from djangocms-blog
*****************************

Migrate from djangocms-blog by following the steps below. There is test coverage for the migration
process - nevertheless be sure to backup your database before proceeding.

1. Uninstall djangocsms-blog: ``pip uninstall djangocms-blog``
2. Install djangocms-stories ``pip install djangocms-stories``
3. Add ``"djangocms_stories"`` to your installed apps. Do **not** remove djangocms-blog.
4. Run ``./manage.py migrate djangocms_stories``. This in migration 0002 will move existing content
   from djangocms-blog to djangocms-stories and delete djangocms-blogs database tables.
5. Remove ``"djangocms_blog"`` from your installed apps.
6. To be on the safe side, check that the app hooks in the advanced settings your blog pages have been
   updated.

**Custom templates will need manual updating**, since the underlying model structure has changed:

* ``post`` contains the following fields: ``related``, ``main_image``, ``author``, ``date``, ``categories``, ``tags``
* ``post_content`` contiains the following per-language fields:
  ``title``, ``subtitle``, ``slug``, ``content``, ``media``, and ``post``, the reference
  to the ``Post`` object.

Some **improvements for developers** are included:

* You now can use the ``{% placeholder %}`` template tag in the post_detail.html template to render
  any placeholder. ``{% render_placeholder post_content.content %}`` and ``{% render_placeholder post_content.media %}``
  are still available, but you can now use ``{% placeholder "new_content" %}`` to, say, add additional placeholders.

# OutlookMCPServer

This project is an MCP server that gives Claude Desktop access to your Microsoft 365 mail, calendar, and files using the Microsoft Graph API.

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **Mail access**: Compose, Respond, Sort, Search, Filter, and Analyze your inbox from Claude or any MCP-compatible agent
- ✅ **Calendar support**: Find invites, List Events, Compose/Update/Send Events
- ✅ **OneDrive support**: Search files, get file metadata
- ✅ **Sharepoint support**: Load drives, search files, get file metadata

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- [`msgraph`](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-python) (modern Microsoft Graph SDK)
- `azure.identity` with `DeviceCodeCredential` and `TokenCachePersistenceOptions`
- `FastMCP` — simple MCP-compliant server interface
- `uv` — fast Python dependency and env management

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

This is currently built to:

- Run locally on **macOS**
- Be used with **Claude Desktop**
- Authenticate using an **Azure-registered application**

> ⚠️ You must have **admin access to an Azure tenant** to configure this — the app registration requires consent for Microsoft Graph scopes (e.g. `Mail.Read`, `Calendars.Read`), which is **not user-consentable** by default in most orgs.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

# Clone the repository and navigate to it
```
git clone https://github.com/Norcim133/OutlookMCPServer.git
cd OutlookMCPServer
```

# Set up the environment
```
uv venv
uv sync
```

# Run locally using MCP Inspector
```
mcp dev main.py (expect errors)
```
It is much easier to get things working in the Inspector before trying to debug in Claude.

## 🔐 Authentication Setup
Before running the application, you need to set up the following:

1. Create an auth_cache folder in the project root (see note):
```BASH
mkdir -p auth_cache
```

2. Create a .env file in the project root
```bash
touch .env
```
3. Add the following to the .env:
```BASH
echo "AZURE_CLIENT_ID=<your-id-from-Azure-portal-here>" > .env
echo "AZURE_TENANT_ID=<your-id-from-Azure-portal-here>" >> .env
echo "AZURE_GRAPH_SCOPES=User.Read Mail.Read Mail.Send Mail.ReadWrite" >> .env
```
NOTE: Additional .env values required for file services
NOTE: On first run, the application will authenticate using the DeviceCodeCredential flow and will create auth_record.json in the auth_cache folder automatically if successful.

### You must have admin access to an Azure tenant to register an application with these permissions.

## Claude for Desktop Integration

To integrate with Claude Desktop, add this to your claude_desktop_config.json:
```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "outlook": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--with",
        "azure-identity,mcp[cli],msgraph-core,msgraph-sdk",
        "mcp",
        "run",
        "/absolute/path/to/OutlookMCPServer"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
In Claude Desktop, you can find the json file by looking in Settings/Developer/Edit Config.

NOTE: You may need to replace "uv" with an absolute reference in "command"

### Restart Claude Desktop each time you make a change to config or to the server code.

                "The Holt-Winters forecasting approach, aka, 'Triple Exponential Smoothing'; is one of a number of exponential smoothing approaches to forecasting that can be used to predict data points in a series, provided that that series contains 'seasonal' aspects, meaning that the series is repetitive over some 'period'. ",
                "This forecasting approach was born out of research aimed at forecasting trends in production, inventories and labor force.  The idea behind triple exponential smoothing is to apply exponential smoothing to the seasonal components in addition to also applying the exponential smoothing to the level and trend components. The smoothing is applied across seasons, e.g. the seasonal component of the 3rd point into the season would be exponentially smoothed with the  one from the 3rd point of last season, 3rd point two seasons ago, etc."

"""A set of tools for quantum calculations.

A Qubit in a regular computer is quantum of algorithm that is executed in
one iteration of a cycle in a separate processor thread.

Quantum is a function with an algorithm of task for data processing.

In this case, the Qubit is not a single information,
but it is a concept of the principle of operation of quantum calculations on a regular computer.

The module contains the following tools:

- `LoopMode` - Quantum loop mode.
- `count_qubits()` - Counting the number of conceptual qubits of your computer.
- `QuantumLoop` - Separation of the cycle into quantum algorithms for multiprocessing data processing.

        task: Function with a task algorithm.
        data: The data that needs to be processed.
        max_workers: The maximum number of processes that can be used to
                     execute the given calls. If None or not given then as many
                     worker processes will be created as the machine has processors.
        timeout: The maximum number of seconds to wait. If None, then there

        chunksize: The size of the chunks the iterable will be broken into

        mode: The operating mode for a quantum loop: LoopMode.PROCESS_POOL | LoopMode.THREAD_POOL.

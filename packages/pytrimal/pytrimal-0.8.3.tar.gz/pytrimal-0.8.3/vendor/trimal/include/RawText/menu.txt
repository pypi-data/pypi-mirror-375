[b][u]Basic usage[r]
    trimal -in <inputfile> -out <outputfile> -(other options).


[b][u]Common options:[r]
For a complete list please see the User Guide or visit http://trimal.cgenomics.org

[b][u]Help Options[r]
    [b]-h[r]
        Print this information and show some examples.
    [b]--version[r]
        Print the trimAl version.
    [b]-v <n> / --verbose <n>[r]
        Specify the verbose level of the program.
        Available options: error / 3, warning / 2, info / 1, none / 0
        Default value: info / 1

[b][u]Input-Output Options[r]
    [b]-in <inputfile>[r]
        Input file in several formats.
        Available input formats: [iformat]

    [b]-formats <format1, ...>[r]
        Specify one or more formats to save the resulting MSA. Separated by spaces
        Combinations with specific format arguments (-fasta, -nexus, etc) is allowed.
        Available output formats: [oformat]

    [b]-out <outputfile>[r]
        Output path pattern. (default stdout).

         Following tags will be replaced if present on filename:
               [in]        -> Original filename without extension.
               [format]    -> Output's format name.
               [extension] -> Output's extension.
               [contig]    -> Contig name. Only applied if using VCF.

         This allows to store on several formats, without overriding the same file,
            as each format would replace the corresponding tags.
         It also allows to store the original filename of the input alignment into
            the result, allowing to reuse the same pattern for all inputs.
         In the case of the tag [contig] allows to store a MSA for each contig found.

         This can be used to store alignments in different folders, depending on the
            format, the input alignment, etc.
         Take in mind trimAl DOES NOT create new folders.

         Note: Format and extension may be the same depending on format.

         Examples:
            trimal -in ./ali1.fasta -out [in].clean.[extension]
                -> ./ali1.clean.fasta

            trimal -in ./alignment2.fasta -out [in].clean.[extension] -clustal
                -> ./file1.alignment2.clw

            trimal -in ./file1.fasta -out alig.[format].[extension] -formats clustal fasta pir
                -> ./alig.clustal.clw
                -> ./alig.pir.pir
                -> ./alig.fasta.fasta

            trimal -in file1.fasta -out ./[in]/trimmed.[format] -formats fasta
                -> ./file1/trimmed.fasta (ONLY if folder file1 already exists)

    [b][u]Overlap Trimming[r]
    Overlap is defined as having a gap in both positions,
        an indetermination in both positions, or a residue in both positions.
    It's main purpose is to remove sequences which share only a reduced region,
        whereas the other regions are not shared with the rest of sequences
        in the alignment and filled with gaps.
    Both arguments must be provided jointly.

        Ex: Sp8 may be removed from the alignment depending on the thresholds.

        Sp8    -----GLG-----------TKSD---NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNWV-----------------
        Sp17   --FAYTAPDLLL-IGFLLKTV-ATFG-----------------DTWFQLWQGLDLNKMPVF
        Sp10   ------DPAVL--FVIMLGTI-TKFS-----------------SEWFFAWLGLEINMMVII

    [b]-seqoverlap <n>[r]
        Minimum percentage of "good positions" that a sequence must have
            in order to be conserved.

        [b]-gat -gapabsolutethreshold <n>[r]
            Max number of gaps allowed on a column to keep it.

        Print overlap scores matrix for all sequences in the input alignment.
        (see User Guide).

[b][u]NGS Support - VCF SNP MSA creator[r]
Suport for VCF files. Providing a reference genome,
    and one or more VCF, multiple MSA are created.
One MSA for each contig present on the whole VCF-dataset.
Each MSA contains the reference sequence
    and a sequence for each donor, with their SNP applied.

    [b]-vcf <inputfile, ...>[r]
        Specify one or more VCF files to produce MSAs
            using the input file (-in <n>) as reference genome.
        It will produce a MSA for each sequence on the original alignment.
        Each MSA will contain the same number of sequences:
            Number of donors + 1 (reference).

        If output file is given, it is recommended to use
            the tag "[contig]" in the filename.
            (See [b]-out[r] explanation)
        Otherwise, the alignments will be stacked
            one upon another on the same file.
        This is valid on formats like fasta or pir,
            but will yield a non-valid file for other formats, such as clustal.

        If no output file pattern is given (-out <outputfile>)
            or it doesn't contain the tag "[contig]",
            the sequences names will have the name of their contig prepended.

    [b]-minquality <n>[r]
        Specify the min quality of a SNP in VCF to apply it.
        Only valid in combination with -vcf.

    [b]-mincoverage <n>[r]
        Specify the min coverage of a SNP in VCF to apply it.
        Only valid in combination with -vcf.

    [b]-ignoreFilter[r]
        Ignore vcf-filtered variants in VCF.
        Only valid in combination with -vcf.
        Still applies min-quality and min-coverage when provided.

- [x] Implement prompt generation logic
  - [x] Base prompt template with instructions and response format
  - [x] Language-specific adaptations
  - [x] Original vs. new code comparison handling
  - [x] Issue-specific prompt sections

## Phase 4: Tool Implementation âœ…

- [x] Implement the `analyze_changes` tool
  - [x] Define input schema (code, original code, language, focus areas)
  - [x] Implement tool execution handler
  - [x] Generate structured analysis prompts
  - [x] Format and return results

## Phase 5: Testing ðŸ”„

- [x] Implement unit tests for all components
  - [x] Core server functionality

# `secrecy`

A symmetric encryption utility.

## Overview

Installing the `secrecy` package from PyPI (or building
it from source, if you insist) gives you command-line access
to the `secrecy` shell command. To install the package,
you can run the following commands:

```bash
python -m venv venv       # Create a virtual environment.
source venv/bin/activate  # Activate the virtual environment.
pip install --upgrade pip # Make sure you have the latest version of `pip`.
pip install secrecy       # Download and install the `secrecy` package.
```

After installation, type `secrecy` in your terminal, and press enter.
If the installation was successful, you will see the CLI's "help" text.

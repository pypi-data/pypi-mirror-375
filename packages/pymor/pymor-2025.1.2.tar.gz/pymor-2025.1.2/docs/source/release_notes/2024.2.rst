pyMOR 2024.2 contains contributions by Maximilian Bindhak, Dmitry Kabanov and Art Pelling.
See `here <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/blob/main/AUTHORS.md>`__ for more details.


Main new features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Randomized leave-one-out error estimator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In `[#2370] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/2370>`_, a leave-one-out error estimator
for the :class:`~pymor.algorithms.rand_la.RandomizedRangeFinder` was implemented.
The leave-one-out error estimator can be activated by setting `error_estimator='loo'`
and estimates the Frobenius norm of the approximation error. Note that while it can be
much more efficient practice, this approach only supports Euclidean inner
products so far, and there are no guarantees on its failure probability.

Recalculated shifted Cholesky QR algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We implemented a version of the Shifted Cholesky QR algorithm in
`[#2304] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/2304>`_, in which the shift is
recalculated in every iteration. The algorithms works reliably even for highly
ill-conditioned matrices.

Improved handling of time-dependent parameter values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The concept of time-dependent parameter values was improved and made clearer
`[#2385] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/2385>`_. There is now a strict distinction
between constant values and time-dependent values. In particular, code that is not aware
of time-dependent parameter values will no longer silently fail when such values are
provided.


Backward incompatible changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Dropped Python 3.8 support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Support for Python version 3.8 was dropped `[#2358] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/2358>`_.
The oldest supported version is now Python 3.9.

Removed ids for vector spaces
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Identifiers for |VectorSpaces| were removed completely in
`[#2357] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/2357>`_ and are not supported anymore.

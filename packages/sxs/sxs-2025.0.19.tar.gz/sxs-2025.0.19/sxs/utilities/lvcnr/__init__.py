"""Convert to/from LVC-NR format

The LVC-NR format was first described in https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01076.  The de
facto format definition is in the code that checks it, which seems to be the
`lvcnrpy` module â€” more specifically, the classes in lvcnrpy.format.specs at
https://git.ligo.org/waveforms/lvcnrpy

Note that most of the code in this submodule related to metadata is adapted from
code written by Alyssa Garcia, Geoffrey Lovelace, and Patricia Schmidt.  The main
difference from [romspline](https://github.com/crgalley/romspline) is in the
decimation method and modified tolerances, making it ~4000x faster for typical
SXS waveforms, while producing files that are slightly smaller on average, but
still just as accurate (in the L^2 measure).

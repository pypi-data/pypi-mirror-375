# The design here is a bit strange and warrants some explanation. We want a clean
# interface, which means that ideally we can pass arguments to the basis that relate to
# setting up the basis. MGCV instead uses xt and m to mean various things for different
# basis functions, and passes this to s. To avoid that we store them with the basis and
# provide a _pass_to_s method. Whilst it would be nice to just create the ro.RObjects as
# a dictionary of kwargs and pass them to s, because s is evaluated in a formula
# context, we have to map xt and m to strings (evaluated literally) or variable names.
# xt can be large (e.g. arrays) so we cannot map this to a string, so we map it to
# a variable name. m tends to be small, so we store it as a python variable and convert
# to a string in the formula.

    """Duchon spline basis - a generalization of thin plate splines.

    These smoothers allow the use of lower orders of derivative in the penalty than
    conventional thin plate splines, while still yielding continuous functions.

    The description, adapted from mgcv is as follows: Duchonâ€™s (1977) construction
    generalizes the usual thin plate spline penalty as follows. The usual thin plate
    spline penalty is given by the integral of the squared Euclidian norm of a vector of
    mixed partial $m$-th order derivatives of the function w.r.t. its arguments. Duchon
    re-expresses this penalty in the Fourier domain, and then weights the squared norm
    in the integral by the Euclidean norm of the fourier frequencies, raised to the
    power $2s$, where $s$ is a user selected constant.

    If $d$ is the number of arguments of the smooth:

    - It is required that $-d/2 < s < d/2$.
    - If $s=0$ then the usual thin plate spline is recovered.
    - To obtain continuous functions we further require that $m + s > d/2$.

    For example, ``DuchonSpline(m=1, s=d/2)`` can be used in order to use first
    derivative penalization for any $d$, and still yield continuous functions.

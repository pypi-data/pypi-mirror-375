# The Tech Job Market Crisis of 2025: Understanding Reddit's Perspective Across Product, Design, and Engineering

## Summary

The tech job market in 2025 has entered a state of unprecedented dysfunction across product management, design, and software engineering disciplines. What started as post-pandemic corrections has evolved into something far more systemic—a fundamental breakdown in how companies hire, value, and structure technical roles. Reddit communities across these disciplines reveal strikingly similar patterns of frustration, but with discipline-specific manifestations that illuminate the broader crisis.

The conversation isn't just about difficulty finding jobs; it's about a hiring ecosystem that has become actively hostile to candidates while simultaneously failing to meet employer needs. From companies systematically lowering salaries through repeated job postings to the weaponization of AI as both a threat and a gatekeeping tool, the dysfunction runs deep. Most tellingly, experienced professionals across all three disciplines are questioning not just their job prospects, but the fundamental viability of their careers in tech.

## The Conversation Landscape

The discussion spans from tactical frustrations in r/cscareerquestions to existential career questioning in r/userexperience, with r/ProductManagement caught between evolving role expectations and diminishing opportunities. What makes this conversation particularly revealing is how different communities frame the same underlying problems through their disciplinary lenses—engineers focus on quantifiable metrics like the 36% drop in job postings, designers worry about AI replacing visual creativity, and product managers grapple with increasingly impossible skill requirements.

Key communities analyzed:
- **r/cscareerquestions & r/ExperiencedDevs**: Focus on market statistics, salary erosion, and the death of junior roles
- **r/userexperience & r/UXDesign**: Emphasis on portfolio optimization futility and the collapse of UX as a discipline
- **r/ProductManagement**: Debates about expanding skill requirements and role ambiguity
- **r/UXResearch**: Deep concern about the elimination of specialized roles
- **r/programming & r/webdev**: Technical discussions about AI's actual capabilities versus hype

## Major Themes

### Theme 1: The Salary Discovery Scam—How Companies Weaponized Job Postings

The most insidious pattern emerging across Reddit is the systematic manipulation of job postings to discover and drive down market salaries. This isn't standard negotiation—it's a coordinated price discovery mechanism that wastes candidates' time while eroding compensation standards across the industry.

A software engineer's experience in the Bay Area crystallized this pattern perfectly: after agreeing to their salary requirements and fast-tracking them through interviews, the company reposted the same role with a lower salary range the next day before rejecting them ([r/cscareerquestions](https://reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1n2v5rt)). The top-voted comment revealed the mechanism: "What they will do is continue to repost it, each time lowering the salary. They do this until they notice a big drop off in applications. This is when they actually start interviewing" (559 upvotes). Another developer confirmed seeing Airbnb do this repeatedly, getting rejected instantly despite being "a perfect fit," only to see the role reposted 20k lower ([r/cscareerquestions](https://reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1n2v5rt)).

The human toll is visceral. One engineer wrote: "It took me a while to realize it but corporate America is really the reason why I have trust issues" (38 upvotes, [r/cscareerquestions](https://reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1n2v5rt)). A UX designer with 10 years experience reported being pushed down from $100k to $90k for a "mediocre web agency job"—and still not getting it ([r/userexperience](https://reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/1n0qfbh)). The pattern extends globally, with companies like Nvidia being called out for the same practices: "Nvidia did this to me. I don't care what they will pay me now, Fuck'em!" (30 upvotes).

What makes this particularly damaging is how it creates a race to the bottom across disciplines. Product managers report similar experiences, with one noting their agreed-upon compensation was suddenly "too high" after the company tested the market. The systematic nature suggests this isn't individual company policy but an emergent industry practice, enabled by the power imbalance in the current market. As one commenter noted grimly: "The sad part is if a company did not do this, then wall street and their capital markets will punish the firm with a lower valuation" ([r/cscareerquestions](https://reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1n2v5rt)).

### Theme 2: The AI Paradox—Eliminating Juniors While Demanding AI Expertise

Across all three disciplines, AI has become both the supposed replacement for workers and a new mandatory skill that everyone must demonstrate—creating a paradoxical situation where companies claim AI makes junior roles obsolete while simultaneously demanding all candidates prove AI proficiency.

The statistics paint a stark picture: "54% of engineering leaders expect fewer junior hires because of AI coding tools" ([r/programming](https://reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1mq1okh)), while simultaneously "36% drop in U.S. tech job postings since pre-pandemic levels. 5 years of over 100,000+ CS graduates per year since then" (1185 upvotes, [r/cscareerquestions](https://reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1mk6kyg)). Yet the AWS CEO called replacing junior developers with AI "the dumbest thing he's ever heard" (8123 upvotes, [r/programming](https://reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1mzofsk)), highlighting the disconnect between executive rhetoric and hiring practices.

The human impact is devastating. A frustrated developer captured the sentiment: "I don't want to command AI agents" (1054 upvotes, [r/ExperiencedDevs](https://reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1mvbqy5)). In product management, Shopify's new requirement that PM candidates build prototypes using AI during interviews (453 upvotes, [r/ProductManagement](https://reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/1mti73r)) sparked heated debate, with one commenter noting: "Before you know it, pm will be shipping shit code" (398 upvotes). The Coinbase CEO took it further, reportedly firing engineers who didn't immediately adopt AI tools (1294 upvotes, [r/webdev](https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1mz4yxl)).

For designers, the threat feels existential. "I'm tired of the AI trends," wrote one designer (287 upvotes, [r/UXDesign](https://reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1n35276)), while another noted: "AI is doing such a good job. I tested Gemini AI and Claude AI with very complex requirement, and it created amazing UX within 3 prompts" ([r/userexperience](https://reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/1n0qfbh)). The fear isn't abstract—UX researchers report entire departments being eliminated, with one noting: "Just got laid off" becoming a common post title (136 upvotes, [r/UXResearch](https://reddit.com/r/UXResearch/comments/1muq8yv)).

Yet experienced practitioners across disciplines recognize the hype. "AI is not nearly as good as people think" garnered 1839 upvotes on r/webdev, with MIT research showing "AI isn't replacing you… it's just wasting your boss's money" (1822 upvotes, [r/programming](https://reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1n8ljce)). The consensus among experienced developers: "No, AI Isn't The Reason You Can't Find A Job" (890 upvotes, [r/cscareerquestions](https://reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1mlrhlj)). Instead, it's become a convenient scapegoat for deeper structural problems.

### Theme 3: The Death of Specialization—Everyone Must Do Everything

The most profound shift across tech roles is the systematic elimination of specialization in favor of impossible "unicorn" requirements. This isn't just role creep—it's a fundamental restructuring of how tech work is organized and valued.

In UX, the change is stark: "I think UX and UR are dead broadly speaking... All jobs I see (APAC/SEA) are for UI/UX... Now it's going even further, where you should be able to code your own prototypes, do research, do product design, service design, marketing, everything" ([r/userexperience](https://reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/1n0qfbh)). One designer with 13 years experience across multiple industries confirmed: "All the big companies down here have shed teams like Content Design, and now the other designers are required to do that work without training."

Product managers face similar expansion: beyond traditional responsibilities, they're now expected to code prototypes (Shopify), understand technical architecture deeply enough to build with AI, maintain business acumen, and somehow still focus on customer discovery. As one PM noted: "The position of Product Manager is already an over indexing of skills and job titles" ([r/ProductManagement](https://reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/1mti73r)). A design engineer highlighted the dysfunction: "PMs give me a v0 or lovable prototype and ask to fix it with our design system... like i am sorry thats not how it works" (187 upvotes).

For engineers, the pattern manifests differently but equally problematically. One experienced developer noted: "Junior devs not interested in software engineering" (1755 upvotes, [r/ExperiencedDevs](https://reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1mrfgm2))—but the comments revealed this isn't apathy but rational response to seeing senior engineers doing everything from DevOps to UI design to product strategy. The elimination of junior roles means no pipeline for specialization, creating a vicious cycle where everyone must know everything but has no path to develop deep expertise.

The irony is palpable: while companies demand broader skillsets, they simultaneously complain about quality. As one commenter noted about prototyping requirements: "Your top job as a PM is to understand your users, your business, and how to deliver value and measure it. This type of interview doesn't seem to hit on any of that" ([r/ProductManagement](https://reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/1mti73r)). The push for generalization is degrading the very specialized skills that made these roles valuable.

### Theme 4: The Experience Paradox—Seniors Competing for Junior Salaries

A cruel inversion has occurred in the tech job market: experience has become a liability rather than an asset, with senior professionals forced to compete for junior-level positions at drastically reduced compensation—if they can get interviews at all.

The numbers tell a devastating story. A UX designer with 10 years experience reported having to negotiate for $100k—and being pushed toward $90k—for agency work ([r/userexperience](https://reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/1n0qfbh)). Another designer was offered "an insultingly low rate" for contract work despite extensive experience. In software engineering, the pattern repeats: "50/hr pay and most likely part time" for experienced contractors, with one developer noting this represents a 50% pay cut from previous norms ([r/cscareerquestions](https://reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1n2v5rt)).

The psychological impact on senior professionals is profound. "Finally got an offer after a layoff as a 50+ year old SWE" (1269 upvotes, [r/ExperiencedDevs](https://reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1n74jad)) became a celebrated post precisely because it's so rare. A 20-year web design veteran wrote: "I'm assuming I won't find a job for a while... preparing myself to be unemployed (for the first time since i was 15) for at least a year" ([r/userexperience](https://reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/1n0qfbh)). The existential questioning is pervasive: "thinking about pivoting careers cause do I want to keep this up in my 40s."

What makes this particularly bitter is how experience is simultaneously demanded and devalued. Job postings require 10+ years experience but offer junior salaries. One PM shared how they were rejected from a junior position for failing tests, only to be hired as a senior after gaining experience elsewhere—highlighting how arbitrary the evaluation has become ([r/ProductManagement](https://reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/1mti73r)). The consensus is darkening: "Anyone else think the UX job market will be dead for the next year or more?" (55 upvotes, [r/userexperience](https://reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/1n0qfbh)).

For many, the solution is abandoning employment altogether. "The age of employee is winding down and the age of micro entrepreneurs is emerging" wrote one designer, while others discuss pivoting to completely different careers. The brain drain is real and accelerating.

### Theme 5: The Interview Theater—Performative Hiring That Helps No One

The hiring process itself has devolved into elaborate theater that neither identifies good candidates nor serves company needs, creating a system where everyone—candidates, hiring managers, and companies—loses.

The absurdity peaks with take-home assignments that are obvious work theft. "Company sends me a suspicious 'take-home assignment'" (1364 upvotes, [r/webdev](https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1n0jxu2)) detailed how companies request full production-ready features as "assessments." One engineer exposed how they "uncovered a scam trying to hire for a remote engineer position" (511 upvotes, [r/cscareerquestions](https://reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1mxg0g9)). The pattern is so common it's become a meme: companies getting free work under the guise of "evaluating" candidates who never had a real chance.

The inefficiency is staggering. "Hundreds of Applicants, One Role: A Tech Hiring Bloodbath" (186 upvotes, [r/cscareerquestions](https://reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1n1cgjh)) captured the reality where hiring managers wade through thousands of applications—many from bots—while qualified candidates can't get callbacks. One hiring manager in UX confirmed: "after narrowing things down still have to choose between ~30 very qualified people for one spot" ([r/userexperience](https://reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/1n0qfbh)).

Product managers face particularly bizarre requirements. Shopify's new coding interview (458 upvotes) sparked debate about testing the wrong skills entirely. As one experienced PM noted: "3-4 questions are enough for me to know if someone knows what they're talking about" rather than elaborate prototyping exercises. The consensus: these aren't real evaluations but corporate theater designed to justify predetermined decisions or gather market intelligence.

Most damningly, many jobs aren't even real. "Most of these 'fake jobs' are known to be fake by the hiring manager" ([r/cscareerquestions](https://reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1n2v5rt)), linking to reports about "ghost jobs" posted for market research, visa compliance, or investor relations—never intending to hire. The demoralization is complete: "176 total applications has only gotten me one mediocre interview" despite 10 years experience and an optimized portfolio ([r/userexperience](https://reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/1n0qfbh)).

## Divergent Perspectives

While the frustration is universal, different communities reveal distinct coping mechanisms and interpretations of the crisis. Software engineers focus on quantifiable metrics and systemic analysis—tracking drops in job postings, measuring application-to-interview ratios, and documenting salary erosion with data. Their discussions emphasize market forces and economic cycles, maintaining some faith that technical skills will eventually regain value.

Designers and UX professionals express more existential concern, questioning whether their entire discipline is becoming obsolete. Where engineers see market cycles, designers see fundamental devaluation of human-centered design. The r/UXResearch community particularly shows signs of professional grief, with "vent posts" and "giving up" threads becoming common.

Product managers occupy a unique middle ground, debating whether to embrace technical skills (learning to code) or double down on strategic business value. Their discussions reveal deep uncertainty about role identity—are they becoming junior developers, pseudo-designers, or something else entirely?

Interestingly, the most senior professionals across all disciplines converge on similar conclusions: the problem isn't technology or market conditions but a fundamental breakdown in how companies understand and value technical work. A 40-year programming veteran's reflection on "vibe coding" (948 upvotes, [r/programming](https://reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1n2cmqo)) aligned surprisingly with UX researchers lamenting the loss of scientific rigor—both seeing a shift from craft to cargo cult.

## What This Means

The Reddit data reveals a job market in fundamental crisis, not temporary correction. The simultaneous devaluation of experience, elimination of entry-level paths, and impossible skill requirements create an unsustainable system heading toward collapse. Companies pursuing short-term cost reduction through salary manipulation and AI adoption are destroying the very talent pipelines they depend on.

For professionals in these fields, the message is clear: traditional career paths are broken. The most successful are those who either achieve exceptional differentiation, build independent revenue streams, or pivot entirely. The era of stable, progressive tech careers appears to be ending, replaced by a gig economy with enterprise salaries.

For companies, the dysfunction is equally damaging. The inability to hire effectively while claiming "talent shortage," the waste of elaborate hiring processes that don't identify good candidates, and the destruction of institutional knowledge through constant turnover create a competitive disadvantage that market forces will eventually punish. The companies that recognize this first and return to valuing deep expertise and sustainable talent development will have significant advantage—if any professionals are left to hire.

Key takeaways:
1. The job market dysfunction is systematic, not cyclical—requiring fundamental restructuring rather than patience
2. Traditional career progression is dead; professionals must architect entirely new paths
3. Companies are destroying long-term value for short-term cost optimization, creating opportunity for those who break the pattern
4. The specialization that made tech valuable is being eliminated, potentially destroying the industry's innovation capacity
5. The gap between hiring rhetoric and reality has never been wider—trust is completely broken

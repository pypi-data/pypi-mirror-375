"""
Module containing reward functions for the Ethical Gardeners environment.

This module defines some reward function used to compute rewards for agents:

* :py:meth:`~RewardFunctions.compute_ecology_reward`: Computes the ecological
  reward based on the agent's action, specifically for planting and
  harvesting flowers.
* :py:meth:`~RewardFunctions.compute_wellbeing_reward`: Computes the well-being
  reward based on the agent's action, specifically for selling flowers and
  giving a penalty for not earning money.
* :py:meth:`~RewardFunctions.compute_biodiversity_reward`: Computes the
  biodiversity reward based on the number of different flower types planted
  by all the agents and how much the agent helps increase diversity.

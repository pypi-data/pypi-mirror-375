## 📖 Usage (Python)

### Extract from Any Bank by URL

```python
from ethiobank_receipts import extract_receipt
from pprint import pprint

urls = {
    "cbe": "https://apps.cbe.com.et:100/?id=FT*************",
    "dashen": "https://receipt.dashensuperapp.com/receipt/**************",
    "awash": "https://awashpay.awashbank.com:8225/-*****************",
    "boa": "https://cs.bankofabyssinia.com/slip/?trx=****************",
    "zemen": "https://share.zemenbank.com/rt/****************/pdf",
    "tele": "CHQ0FJ403O"
}

for bank, url in urls.items():
    print(f"Extracting from {bank}...")
    try:
        result = extract_receipt(bank, url)
        pprint(result)
    except Exception as e:
        pprint(f"Failed: {e}")
```

### Extract CBE with FT Number + Account

```python
from ethiobank_receipts.extractors.cbe import extract_cbe_receipt_info_from_ft

data = extract_cbe_receipt_info_from_ft("FT25211G11JQ", "21827223")
print(data)
```

✔ Normalizes FT format (uppercase, trims spaces)
✔ Uses last 8 digits of account
❌ Raises `ValueError` if account digits < 8

### Extract Telebirr by URL or Receipt ID

```python
from ethiobank_receipts import extract_receipt

# With full URL
data1 = extract_receipt("tele", "https://transactioninfo.ethiotelecom.et/receipt/CHQ0FJ403O")

# Or just the ID
data2 = extract_receipt("tele", "CHQ0FJ403O")
```

## 🌐 Hosting Limitations

Some receipt systems have **regional restrictions**:

* **Telebirr** often blocks or times out requests from **foreign IPs**.

  * Errors include: `403`, `ERR_FAILED`, or DNS resolution issues.
  * ❌ Affected: VPS or cloud servers outside Ethiopia (e.g., AWS, Hetzner).
  * ✅ Works Best: Servers hosted in Ethiopia (e.g., Ethio Telecom hosting, TeleCloud VPS).

* **Bank of Abyssinia (BOA)** receipts require **Chrome WebDriver**.
  The extractor caches driver sessions for performance.

---

## 🛠 Notes

* Always provide the correct **reference number** or **receipt URL**.
* For CBE, you may use **FT number + last 8 digits of account** instead of full URL.
* If fewer than 8 digits are provided for CBE accounts, a `ValueError` is raised.

**ShahMat** is a Python package that leverages the official [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com) API to **fetch, analyze, and visualize your games**.  
It is part of the [AG Algo Lab](https://ag-algolab.github.io/) initiative: making finance & tech accessible to everyone — and yes, sometimes we have fun applying data science to chess too!

The name *ShahMat* comes from the ancient expression that later gave birth to the word **“checkmate”** :)

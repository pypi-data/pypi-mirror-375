[prep CDF-25553] ðŸ‘· Refactor purge instances (#1877)

# Description

<del>Stacked on #1876, #1875, #1878</del>

Preparation for purge instances taking in a csv file with exactly which
instances to delete.

Note I am taking a different approach to unlink. Instead of checking if
the node has properties in the CogniteFile/CogniteTimeSeries container,
I simply try to retrieve them from the files/timeseries API and if they
are there unlink.

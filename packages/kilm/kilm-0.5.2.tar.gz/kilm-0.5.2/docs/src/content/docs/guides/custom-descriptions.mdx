title: Custom Descriptions & Metadata
description: Adding detailed descriptions and metadata to your libraries.
---

> **Note:** This guide is primarily aimed at **Creators** â€“ those setting up and managing the shared KiCad libraries.

While KiLM manages adding libraries to KiCad, KiCad itself displays a description for each library in its managers.

KiLM allows you to define these descriptions centrally within your library repository by looking for a specific YAML file.

## `library_descriptions.yaml`

If you place a file named `library_descriptions.yaml` in the root of a library directory that you have initialized with `kilm init`, KiLM will read this file when running `kilm setup`.

The expected format for this file is:

```yaml
# Symbol library descriptions
symbols:
  "KiCad-Connector": "This is the description for the KiCad Connector library that will appear in KiCad."
  "KiCad-Analog": "Contains specialized analog components and basic analog parts."

# Footprint library descriptions
footprints:
  "KiCad-Connector": "Description for the KiCad Connector footprint library (can be different from symbol desc)."
  "Custom-Breakouts": "Footprints for custom breakout boards and development modules."
```

**Key Points:**

- **Keys are Logical Names:** The keys under `symbols` and `footprints` (`LogicalLibraryName1`, `AnotherSymbolLib`, etc.) must match the actual _logical_ names of the libraries as defined in KiCad's library tables (`sym-lib-table` or `fp-lib-table`). These logical names may differ from the actual filenames.
- **Matching:** KiLM uses these logical names to find the corresponding library entry in KiCad's `sym-lib-table` or `fp-lib-table` and sets the description field.
- **Location:** The `library_descriptions.yaml` file must be in the root of the library directory managed by `kilm init`.
- **Setup Required:** These descriptions are applied only when you run `kilm setup`.

This provides a way to keep your library descriptions version-controlled alongside your library files.

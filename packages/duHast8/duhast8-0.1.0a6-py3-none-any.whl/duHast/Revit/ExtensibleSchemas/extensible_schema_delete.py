This module contains a number of functions around Extensible storage deletion in Revit.

Notes from the building coder website: https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2022/11/extensible-storage-schema-deletion.html


The devteam replied: After running DeleteSchemas macro, open Manage > Purge Unused. In the tree, select Extensible Storage Schema. Check the schema a9dc2b48 and click OK to purge it. Run ListSchemas â€“ the schema is purged. So, please use Purge Unused to delete schemas without entities.

Extensible storage schema is an application-wide object. If it exists at all in the application, it will populate and "infect" every single document that you touch. That makes it hard to remove, and complicated to understand.


Personally I found:

- The schema is not removed from the document when you delete it. You have to purge it manually.
- If the schema exists in a link and you delete it, it will not go away ... unload  any links or replace any links with dummy links without the schema and attempt to delete and purge again.

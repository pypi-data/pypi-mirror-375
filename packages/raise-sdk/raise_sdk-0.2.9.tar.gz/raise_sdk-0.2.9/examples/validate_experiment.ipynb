    "### Check Installation of `raise_sdk`\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running the experiment, ensure that the `raise_sdk` package is installed in your environment. Follow these steps to install and verify the package:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Install the `raise_sdk` package**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the `raise_sdk` package:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pip install raise_sdk\n",
    "\n",
    "This will download and install the package from PyPI (Python Package Index) into your environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Verify Installation**\n",
    "\n",
    "   After installation, you can verify that the package has been installed correctly. Run the following Python code:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import raise_sdk\n",
    "   print(raise_sdk.__version__)\n",
    "\n",
    "If the installation was successful, it should print the version of the raise_sdk package installed in your environment. If no errors are raised, the package is installed and ready to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Troubleshooting**\n",
    "\n",
    "   If you encounter any issues during installation:\n",
    "   - Ensure your Python environment is properly set up.\n",
    "   - If you're using Python 3, you might need to run:\n",
    "\n",
    "      ```bash\n",
    "      pip3 install raise_sdk\n",
    "\n",
    "   - If you're working within a virtual environment, make sure it is activated before running the install command."

def round(input):
    r"""
    Returns half to even of a tensor element-wise.

    .. math::
        out_i \approx input_i

    .. note::
        The input data types supported by the Ascend platform include
        bfloat16 (Atlas training series products are not supported), float16, float32, float64, int32, and int64.

    Args:
        input (Tensor): The input tensor.

    Returns:
        Tensor, has the same shape and type as the `input`.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If `input` is not a Tensor.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

    Examples:
        >>> import mindspore
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from mindspore import Tensor, ops
        >>> input = Tensor(np.array([0.8, 1.5, 2.3, 2.5, -4.5]), mindspore.float32)
        >>> output = mint.special.round(input)
        >>> print(output)

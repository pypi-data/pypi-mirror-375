title: Pipeline Outputs
description: Subject- and group-level outputs produced by an AutoClean run.

# Pipeline Outputs

Each AutoClean run creates a structured folder containing everything needed to reproduce and review your results.

<Note>
The folder name uses the task you executed, allowing multiple tasks to share the same project without overwriting previous runs.
</Note>

## Subject-level artifacts

### `bids/` – cleaned EEG
- Cleaned continuous and epoched data in BIDS format
- Channel metadata and events files

### `derivatives/` – reports and visualizations
- HTML/PDF processing reports
- ICA plots, power spectra, and before/after comparisons

### `logs/` – processing logs
- Step-by-step log of every operation
- Helpful for debugging failed runs

### `metadata/` – run metadata
- JSON files describing parameters and quality metrics
- Links back to the database run record

### `stage_files/` – intermediate exports
- Optional exports from custom steps
- Files are numbered in run order (01_, 02_, …)

### `flagged/` – runs requiring review
- Outputs moved here when quality thresholds are not met

## Group-level artifacts

When multiple subjects are processed, AutoClean can generate group-level summaries:

- **Exported metrics** inside `exported_data/` for downstream analysis
- **Group analysis** results produced by tools such as `assr_viz.py` that aggregate heatmap data into `group_analysis/`
- **Combined reports** that collate per-subject quality metrics

<Tip>
Group folders are safe to delete and regenerate because underlying subject results remain intact.

## Run record

Every run also writes a JSON run record to the internal database capturing the information above and listing output file names. The run ID connects the filesystem results with tools like the review interface.

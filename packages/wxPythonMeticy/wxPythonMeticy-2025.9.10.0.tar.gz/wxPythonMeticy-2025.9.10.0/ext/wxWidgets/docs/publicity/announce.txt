May 25, 2025 -- The wxWidgets team is pleased to announce a new
stable release of our open source framework for the development of native
cross-platform applications in C++.

wxWidgets 3.2.8.1 is part of the API and ABI-stable 3.2.x release series and
is now available from

    https://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/

and

    https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/releases/v3.2.8.1


This is a hotfix release correcting regressions in 3.2.8 for configure builds
on platforms using ELF if --with-flavour is specified (#25436) or LTO is used
with clang (#25438).

Please see the full change log for more details, including all changes since
the last but one stable 3.2.7 release:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/v3.2.8.1/docs/changes.txt

This release is API and ABI-compatible with the previous 3.2.x, meaning that
the existing applications don't even need to be rebuilt to profit from all the
fixes above if they use shared/dynamic libraries. And if they do need to be
recompiled, this can be done without any changes to the code.

We hope that you will enjoy using the new release!

Vadim Zeitlin, on behalf of wxWidgets development team.

### DETAILS: 

# The structure is based of 6LFO but with missing
# loops. This generates 6 molecules on martinize2
# level. In a merged molecule there should however
# be gaps in the resid when the original ones are
# kept. The last three resids are set to 900 to
# check if some crazy value works

### TEST: 

# - keep old resids with gaps upon merge
# - apply EN within all molecules

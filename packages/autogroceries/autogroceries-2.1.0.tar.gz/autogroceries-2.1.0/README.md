`autogroceries` simplifies grocery shopping from Sainsbury's by using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) to automate the addition of ingredients to your basket.

## Installation

I recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage the python version, virtual environment and `autogroceries` installation:

```bash
uv venv --python 3.13
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install autogroceries
# Install Chromium browser binary required for playwright.
playwright install chromium
```

## Usage

`autogroceries` uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) to interface with the Sainsbury's website, automatically filling your cart with an inputted list of ingredients. `autogroceries` can be used as a CLI tool or a python package.

### CLI

`autogroceries` has a single CLI command:

```bash
‚ùØ autogroceries --help
Usage: autogroceries [OPTIONS]

  Automate your grocery shopping using playwright.

  Please set the [STORE]_USERNAME and [STORE]_PASSWORD in a .env file in the
  same directory you run autogroceries. Replace [STORE] with the store name in
  caps e.g. SAINSBURYS_USERNAME.

Options:
  --store [sainsburys]     The store to shop at.  [required]
  --ingredients-path PATH  Path to csv file (without header) detailing
                           ingredients. Each line should in format
                           'ingredient,quantity' e.g. 'eggs,2'.  [required]
  --log-path PATH          If provided, will output shopping log to this path.
  --help                   Show this message and exit.
```

The `autogroceries` CLI expects a `.env` file in the same directory from where you execute the command. This `.env` will be loaded by [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) and should define the "[STORE]_USERNAME" and "[STORE]_PASSWORD" variables, with "[STORE]" replaced by the name of the store in uppercase, for instance:

```bash
# .env
SAINSBURYS_USERNAME=your_username
SAINSBURYS_PASSWORD=your_password
```

### Python package

`autogroceries` can be used as a Python package, making it easy to integrate automated grocery shopping into scripts or pipelines:

```python
from autogroceries.shopper.sainsburys import SainsburysShopper

# Store credentials securely e.g. in environment variables (loaded with python-dotenv).
shopper = SainsburysShopper(
        username=os.getenv("SAINSBURYS_USERNAME"),
        password=os.getenv("SAINSBURYS_PASSWORD"),
    )

shopper.shop({"lemon": 1, "tomatoes": 2})
```

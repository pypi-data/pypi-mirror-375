# Organisation

The CANFAR consortium is represented by a network of university researchers that participate in determining directions and emphasis of the consortium and form the Science Management Committee.

The day-to-day operation of the consortium is coordinated by the management team which consists of:

| Name | Role |

| Pauline Barmby | DRAC & RPP Lead (UWO) |
| Sharon Goliath | Operations Lead (CADC) |
| Brian Major | Software Development Lead (CADC) |
| Management Lead| JJ Kavelaars (CADC/UVic) |

The consortium has an advisory [Science Management Committee](governance.md#science-management-committee) that has both scientific and computational and data expertise representation.

Agreements between members may formalize relations as needed.

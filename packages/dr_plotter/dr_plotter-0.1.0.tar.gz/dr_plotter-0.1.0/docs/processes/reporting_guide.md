# Project Reporting Guide

## Overview
We use two complementary report types optimized for different purposes:

- **Lab Notebook**: Technical reference for future debugging and implementation details
- **Strategic Report**: Decision context and reusable insights for future projects

## Templates
- `docs/processes/lab_notebook_template.md` - Technical reference format
- `docs/processes/strategic_report_template.md` - Strategic insights format

## Example Reports
See complete examples from dr_plotter migration:
- `docs/reports/2025-08-25_dr_plotter_migration/migration_lab_notes.md` 
- `docs/reports/2025-08-25_dr_plotter_migration/migration_strategic_report.md`

## When to Create Reports
Use for any project requiring 3+ steps or complex coordination. Both documents should be created together.

## Key Principles
- **Lab Notebook**: Dense technical facts, file:line references, bugs/fixes, discoveries
- **Strategic Report**: Decisions with rationale, lessons learned, reusable patterns
- **Length**: Lab notebook ~50 lines max, Strategic report ~60 lines max
- **Tone**: Factual and technical, not promotional

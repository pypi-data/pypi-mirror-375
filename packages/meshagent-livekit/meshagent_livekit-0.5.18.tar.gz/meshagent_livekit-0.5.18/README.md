## MeshAgent LiveKit
The ``meshagent.livekit`` package equips agents with real-time audio and voice capabilities via the LiveKit SDK. 

### VoiceBot
The ``VoiceBot`` agent handles two-way voice conversations allowing users to interact with the agent verbally. Agents based on the ``VoiceBot`` class can be given the same tools as ``ChatBot`` based agents. This means you only need to write a tool once and the same tool can be used across both text and voice based agents. Check out the [Build and Deploy a Voice Agent](https://docs.meshagent.com/agents/standard/buildanddeployvoicebot) example to learn how to create a simple Voice Agent without tools then add built-in MeshAgent tools and custom tools to the agent.

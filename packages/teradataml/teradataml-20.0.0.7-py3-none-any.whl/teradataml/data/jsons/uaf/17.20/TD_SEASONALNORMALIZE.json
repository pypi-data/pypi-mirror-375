The TD_SEASONALNORMALIZE function takes a logical-runtime series, with real number elements (containing the original series, Xt), as an input, with a SERIES_SPEC(INTERVAL()) and a FUNC_PARAMS(SEASON_CYCLE()) declaration, specifying the season and cycle duration respectively for data normalization.  The function then generates a series having the same number of sample points as the input series, where the generated series has been normalized with respect to its internal period as a season and interval cycles.  The data scientist can then perform a statistical test to see whether or not the generated series is stationary and thus ready to model."

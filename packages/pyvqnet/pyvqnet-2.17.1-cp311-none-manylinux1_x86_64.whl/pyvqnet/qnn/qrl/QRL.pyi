    '''
    Quantum Deep Reinforcement Learning Model using a variational quantum circuit.
    This model integrates quantum computing principles with deep reinforcement learning,
    leveraging the power of quantum circuits to process and learn from data in a potentially
    more efficient way than classical models.


    Example::
        from pyvqnet.tensor import tensor, QTensor

        num_qubits = 4
        model = QRLModel(num_qubits=num_qubits, n_layers=2)

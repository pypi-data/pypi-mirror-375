# Reviewing Outputs

AutoClean supplies multiple interfaces to inspect what the pipeline produced.

## File explorer

The simplest way to browse results. Each run lives in its own task-named folder. Use your operating system's file explorer or the **Select Directory** button in the review tool to navigate through runs and open reports.

## Qt browser â€“ AutoClean view

MNE's Qt browser displays cleaned data with bad segments highlighted.

```python
import mne
mne.viz.set_browser_backend("qt")
raw.plot()
```

Load continuous or epoched files from the `bids/` folder to scroll through recordings with all AutoClean annotations applied.

## AutoClean review

A dedicated GUI (`autoclean_review`) combines browsing, visualization, and run metadata.

- Tree-based file navigator
- Report and metadata preview
- Buttons to open raw or epochs in the Qt browser
- Optional export to EEGLAB `.set` format

<Tip>
Install GUI extras with `pip install autocleaneeg-pipeline[gui]` to enable the review interface.

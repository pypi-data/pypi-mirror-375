## \namespace motorhome
# This contains a class and helper function for making automated homing
# routines.
# You should use the PLC object to create an autohoming PLC, then load it onto
# the PMAC or GEOBRICK. You will need the \ref autohome.vdb "autohome.template"
# EPICS template to be able to start, stop and monitor this PLC.
#
# The following terms will be used in the documentation:
# - hdir = the homing direction. If ixx23 is +ve, hdir is in the direction
# of the high limit. If ixx23 is -ve, hdir is in the direction of the low limit
# - Jog until xx = the <tt>#\<axis\>J^\<jdist\></tt> command. This tells the
# pmac to jog until it sees the home flag, then move jdist counts

    # one phase of the homing protocol. The list should be in the order

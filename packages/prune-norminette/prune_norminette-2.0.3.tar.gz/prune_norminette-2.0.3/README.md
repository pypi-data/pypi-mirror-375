# Prune's Norminette

## What is it for?

The norminette automatically checks the organization of files in a Django project as well as code rules.
This allows for the same code standard between projects and makes it easier to navigate.

## Prerequisites

-   To be installed on a Prune Django project that uses UV

### Installation

Run the following command in the console:

```bash
uv add prune_norminette
```

### Running the norminette

To run the package, simply enter in the console:

```bash
uv run prune_norminette
```

### Display rules in the project

To list all the rule checks in the project, run the following command:

```bash
uv run norminette_display_rules
```

### Norminette version

Don't hesitate to regularly run `uv sync --upgrade`, as the norminette evolves with time and our practices!

You can also pin the norminette to a specific version to avoid breaking changes, as the norminette is changing quickly.

## Publish a new version

To publish a new version of the norminette, run `./publish.sh` from the main branch. It will update pyproject.toml, create a git tab and push it to gitlab. This will trigger a CI/CD job to release the new version of the norminette on pypi.

## For developers: add new rule

The rules are located in the `rules/` folder.

To add a new rule based on a function's docstring, follow this format:

```python
"""
    Id: 10
    Description: Describe what the rule checks.

    Tags:
        - Use relevant tags from the list below.

    Args:
        app (str): The name of the Django app to check.
        errors (list): A list to store error messages if the structure is incorrect.
"""
```

### Available Tags

The currently available tags are:

-   **web_files**: HTML, JS, and CSS files.
-   **python_files**: Python files with `.py` extension.
-   **architecture**: Checks folder and file placement consistency.
-   **format**: Directly modifies file formatting.
-   **files_content**: Inspects file contents.

### Integration Steps

-   Import the new function in `utils/run_checks.py`. (Remember to add errors in args)
-   Sync the new rules to update `README.md`.

To sync rules after adding them to the project, run:

```bash
python -m norminette_prune.utils.rules.generate_readme
```

For adding a tag, add it to the `get_tags_descriptions()` function in `utils/rules/extract_rules.py` file.

    :param dataset: The dataset used for sampling.
    :param num_replicas: (int, optional) The number of processes participating in distributed training.
     If not provided, the :attr:`world_size` is retrieved from the current distributed group.
    :param rank: (int, optional) The rank of the current process within :attr:`num_replicas`. 
    If not provided, the :attr:`rank` is retrieved from the current distributed group.
    :param shuffle: (bool, optional) Whether to shuffle the indices. Defaults to ``True``.
    :param seed: (int, optional) The random seed used to shuffle the sampler if :attr:`shuffle=True`. 
    This seed should be identical across all processes in the distributed group. Defaults to ``0``.
    :param drop_last: (bool, optional) If ``True``, the sampler will drop the tail of the data to make it
     evenly divisible across the number of replicas. If ``False``, the sampler will add extra indices to make the data evenly divisible across the replicas. Defaults to ``False``.

Glue module between ``shopfloor`` and ``stock_checkout_sync``.

When an operation type has the flag "Checkout Sync" activated, the first
move line to be scanned directly synchronizes the destination.

The currently supported scenario that sync the destination locations
are:

-  Cluster Picking
-  Location Content Transfer
-  Zone Picking

Support for other scenarios may be added later.

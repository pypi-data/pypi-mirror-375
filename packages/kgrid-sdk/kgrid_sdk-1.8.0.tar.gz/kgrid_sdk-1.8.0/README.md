# KGrid SDK
Use KGrid SDK library for 
- Creating a python Knowledge object
- Creating a collection

Use KGrid SDK CLI for
- Initiating a KGrid Knowledge Object
- Creating an Information Page for a Knowledge Object or Knowledgebase
- Metadata-Driven Packaging of a Knowledge Object

## Create a python Knowledge Object
You can use this package to implement python Knowledge Objects.

### Add  kgrid_sdk package as a dependency in your Knowledge Object
The `kgrid_sdk` package is available on PyPI and can be easily added as a dependency to your project. Hereâ€™s how to include it in your project based on your setup:

#### Using Poetry
- For the base package:
```bash
poetry add kgrid_sdk
```

- If you need to use the KO-API class, include the api extra:
```
poetry add kgrid_sdk -E api
```

#### Using pip
If you are not using Poetry, you can install the package with pip:
- For the base package:
```
pip install kgrid_sdk
```
- To include the KO-API extra:
```
pip install "kgrid_sdk[api]" 
```
### Use `kgrid_sdk.Ko`
To inherit the core functionalities of the SDK, extend the `kgrid_sdk.Ko` class in your knowledge object. For example:
```python
from kgrid_sdk import Ko

class Prevent_obesity_morbidity_mortality(Ko):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
```
This class adds core functionalities to the knowledge object (KO), such as `get_version` and `get_metadata`.

### Use `kgrid_sdk.Ko_Execution`
The `Ko_Execution` class extends `Ko` to include a universal `execute` method for knowledge objects. The constructor of this class accepts an array of knowledge representations (functions), and the `execute` method can optionally take the name of the function to execute. If no function name is provided, the `execute` method defaults to executing the first function. This is particularly useful for KOs with only one knowledge representation. The knowledge representations could be added as static methods of the knowledge object class or could be defined as individual functions.
```python
from kgrid_sdk import Ko_Execution

class Pregnancy_healthy_weight_gain(Ko_Execution):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__([self.get_pregnancy_healthy_weight_gain_recommendation])

    @staticmethod
    def get_pregnancy_healthy_weight_gain_recommendation(pregnant):
    ...        
```
The `execute` method takes a JSON input, mapping it to the knowledge representation's input parameters using a wrapper. The JSON input may include unrelated parameters, which are ignored by the wrapper.

The `execute` method is used by the SDK's collection class, API, and CLI services.

### Use `kgrid_sdk.Ko_API` and `kgrid_sdk.Ko_CLI`
To implement an API or CLI service for your knowledge object, extend the `kgrid_sdk.Ko_API` and `kgrid_sdk.Ko_CLI` classes:
```python
from kgrid_sdk import Ko_API
from kgrid_sdk import Ko_CLI

class Abdominal_aortic_aneurysm_screening(Ko_API,Ko_CLI):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__([self.get_abdominal_aortic_aneurysm_screening])
```

These classes extend `Ko_Execution` and therefore they include the `execute` method to your knowledge object.

For a complete example of implementing API, CLI, and activator services using the SDK, see the knowledge objects created in our USPSTF collection repository or refer to the example code below:
```python
from kgrid_sdk import Ko_API
from kgrid_sdk import Ko_CLI


class Abdominal_aortic_aneurysm_screening(Ko_API,Ko_CLI):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__([self.get_abdominal_aortic_aneurysm_screening])
        self.add_endpoint("/check-inclusion", tags=["abdominal_aortic_aneurysm_screening"])
    
    @staticmethod
    def get_abdominal_aortic_aneurysm_screening(age, gender, has_never_smoked):
        """
        Parameters:
        - age (int): Age of the person.
        - gender (int): Gender of the individual (0 for women, 1 for men).    
        - has_never_smoked (bool): Whether this person has never smoked or not.

    abdominal_aortic_aneurysm_screening.execute_cli()


def apply(input):
    return abdominal_aortic_aneurysm_screening.execute(input)
```

Note: The activator example requires a service specification file and a deployment file pointing to the `apply` method. For more details, refer to the [Python Activator](https://github.com/kgrid/python-activator) documentation.

## Create a collection using `kgrid_sdk.Collection`
The `kgrid_sdk.Collection` class can be used to create a collection of knowledge objects. Start by importing and creating an instance of the `Collection` class. Use the `add_knowledge_object` method to add knowledge objects that extend `kgrid_sdk.Ko_Execution` or higher-level SDK classes like `kgrid_sdk.Ko_API` or `kgrid_sdk.Ko_CLI`. This requirement ensures that the collection works with KOs containing the SDK `execute` method.
```python
from abdominal_aortic_aneurysm_screening import abdominal_aortic_aneurysm_screening
from cardiovascular_prevention_diet_activity import cardiovascular_prevention_diet_activity
from cardiovascular_prevention_statin_use import cardiovascular_prevention_statin_use
from hypertension_screening import hypertension_screening
from diabetes_screening import diabetes_screening
from high_body_mass_index import high_body_mass_index

from kgrid_sdk.collection import Collection


USPSTF_Collection = Collection("USPSTF_Collection")
USPSTF_Collection.add_knowledge_object( abdominal_aortic_aneurysm_screening )
USPSTF_Collection.add_knowledge_object( cardiovascular_prevention_diet_activity )
USPSTF_Collection.add_knowledge_object( cardiovascular_prevention_statin_use )
USPSTF_Collection.add_knowledge_object( hypertension_screening )
USPSTF_Collection.add_knowledge_object( diabetes_screening )
USPSTF_Collection.add_knowledge_object( high_body_mass_index )
```
Once ready, the collection can be packaged and installed as an external package in any Python application. Here is an example:
```bash
pip install https://github.com/kgrid/python-sdk/releases/download/1.0/uspstf_collection-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

To execute the collection on a patient's data, install and import the `USPSTF_Collection` (if used as a package). Use the `calculate_for_all` method, passing a JSON input that includes all the required parameters for each knowledge object in the collection.
```python
from uspstf_collection import USPSTF_Collection
import json

patient_data={
    "age":42,
    "bmi":33,
    "bmi_percentile":95.5,
    "has_never_smoked": True,
    "has_cardiovascular_risk_factors":True,
    "ten_year_CVD_risk":8,
    "hypertension":False        
}

result = USPSTF_Collection.calculate_for_all(patient_data)
print(json.dumps(result, indent=4))
```



## KGrid CLI
KGrid CLI offers a range of commands to assist with creating, representing, and packaging Knowledge Objects.

### Installation
To use the command line interface (CLI) from the kgrid_sdk package, you must install the CLI as an **_extra_**. Extras are optional dependencies that provide additional functionality. If you are installing the kgrid-sdk from PiPY use `[cli]` to install the CLI:

```bash
pip install "kgrid-sdk[cli]"
```
If you are installing the package from a `.whl` file, add `[cli]` to the end of the `.whl` package name and quote the entire package path. for example:

```bash 
pip install "kgrid-sdk[cli]@https://github.com/kgrid/python-sdk/releases/download/1.0/kgrid_sdk-1.5.0-py3-none-any.whl"
```

After installation, confirm that the CLI is installed and view the list of available commands by running:
```bash
kgrid --help    
```

### Initiate a KGrid Knowledge Object
Use the `init` command to add essential KGrid files, including metadata, to the current directory:
```bash
kgrid init {name} 
```

This command creates the following files in the current directory: `metadata.json`, `README.md`, `license.md`, and a Knowledge Object information page (`index.html`). The `name` parameter specifies the name of the Knowledge Object.
- The `metadata.json` file includes basic metadata.
- The information page reflects the metadata.
The `README.md` and `license.md` files are generated as empty files.

### Create an Information Page for a Knowledge Object or Knowledgebase
To generate an information page for a Knowledge Object or a Knowledgebase using its metadata, use the following command:
```bash
kgrid information-page --metadata-path /path/to/metadata.json --output /path/to/index.html
```

This command processes the specified metadata file to create an information page, including links to resources such as services and knowledge.

#### Parameters
- `--metadata-path`: It specifies the path to the metadata file. If not provided, the command will look for a file named `metadata.json` in the current directory. 
- `--output`: It specifies the output path and file name for the generated information page. If not provided, the page will be saved as `index.html` in the current directory. 
- `--include_relative_paths`: By default, the generated information page includes links to resources such as services and knowledge on the GitHub repository and the branch corresponding to the path where the metadata is located. If the location is not a cloned GitHub repository, or if it is overridden using `--include_relative_paths`, relative paths to resources will be included, pointing to the location where the metadata is stored.



### Metadata-Driven Packaging of a Knowledge Object
Use the `package` CLI command to package the content of a Knowledge Object (KO) based on its metadata. Currently, all relative and absolute local URIs in the metadata are resolved towards the location of the metadata, but external URLs are not included in the package. If a URI resolves to a folder, all contents within the folder are included; if it resolves to a file, only the file is included. By default, the metadata file is always included in the package.

To package the content of the Knowledge Object using its metadata, run the following command:
```bash
kgrid package --metadata-path /path/to/metadata.json --output output.tar.gz 
```

This command processes the specified metadata file and gathers all referenced content. By default the metadata file is included in the package. The resulting package will be saved as a tar.gz file with the specified output location and name. `--metadata-path`, `--output` are optional. 

#### Parameters
- `--metadata-path`: If `--metadata-path` is not provided the command will look for `metadata.json` in the current directory. 
- `--output`: If `--output` is not provided the name of the parent directory where the metadata file is located and the version name will be used as the name of the outpu file and the output package will be saved in the current directory. 
- `--nested`: By default all the file and folders will be added to the root of the package file. Use the option `--nested`to have all the files and folders copied in a folder in the created package with the name of the parent directory and the version. For example

```bash
kgrid package --metadata-path /path/to/metadata.json --nested
```

## Implementation
### Dependency management
To manage dependencies and make it possible to only install dependencies required for what you want to use from SDK we decided to use Python's Optional Dependencies rather than creating separate packages for each class.

Packaging each class separately has its advantages, especially if each class represents a distinct, independent feature with unique dependencies which is not the case in our usecase. However, using optional dependencies within a single package can offer significant benefits in terms of usability and maintainability. Hereâ€™s a comparison to help decide which approach might work best for you

1. Installation Simplicity
With optional dependencies, users install a single package (kgrid_sdk) and add only the extra features they need using extras (e.g., kgrid_sdk[cli]). This is generally simpler and more user-friendly, as all features are accessible through a single, central package

2. Namespace and Code Organization
Keeping everything in a single package means all classes share the same namespace and project structure, making the API simpler and more cohesive for users. They import from kgrid_sdk package regardless of the feature set they need, which simplifies code and documentation.

3. Code Reusability and Dependency Management
A single package with optional dependencies is easier to manage if some classes share common dependencies. You only define common dependencies once, and updates propagate across all features. It also avoids versioning conflicts between interdependent features.

4. User Flexibility and Lightweight Installation
Users can install only what they need, making the package lightweight without requiring multiple packages. It provides flexibility without adding complexity since extras are not installed by default.

5. Version Management and Compatibility
You manage versioning in one central package. Compatibility between the core and extras is generally simpler to control, as everything is versioned and released together.

The current version of the SDK only has optional dependencies for Ko_API class. If this class is used, these optional dependencies could be installed with the package using `-E api` if you are using `poetry install` or `poetry add` and using `[api]` if you are using `pip install`.

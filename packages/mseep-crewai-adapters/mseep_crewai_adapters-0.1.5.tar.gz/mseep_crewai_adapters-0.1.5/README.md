## Installation

You can install the package directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install crewai-adapters
```

Or install from source:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/dshivendra/crewai_mcp_adapter.git

## Quick Start

```python
from crewai import Agent, Task
from crewai_adapters import CrewAIAdapterClient
from crewai_adapters.types import AdapterConfig

async def main():
    async with CrewAIAdapterClient() as client:
        # Connect to MCP server
        await client.connect_to_mcp_server(
            "math",
            command="python",
            args=["math_server.py"]
        )

        # Create agent with tools
        agent = Agent(
            name="Calculator",
            goal="Perform calculations",
            tools=client.get_tools()
        )

        # Execute task
        task = Task(
            description="Calculate (3 + 5) × 12",
            agent=agent
        )
        result = await task.execute()
        print(f"Result: {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(main())
```

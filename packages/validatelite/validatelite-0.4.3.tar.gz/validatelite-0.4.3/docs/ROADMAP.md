- **Dashboard**: Create visualization dashboards for validation results
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Implement real-time validation monitoring

#### Cloud & Enterprise Deployment
- **Cloud Integration**: Support for major cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- **Container Orchestration**: Enhanced Docker and Kubernetes support
- **SaaS Offering**: Potential cloud-hosted service option

#### Workflow Integration
- **Scheduler Integration**: Support for Airflow, Prefect, and other schedulers
- **CI/CD Integration**: Enhanced integration with CI/CD pipelines
- **API Development**: RESTful API for programmatic access

#### Metadata Management
- **Rule Catalog**: Centralized rule management and sharing
- **Validation History**: Comprehensive audit trail and history
- **Team Collaboration**: Multi-user support and role-based access

### 3. Domain-Specific Solutions

#### Schema Validation
- **Schema Evolution**: Track and validate schema changes over time
- **Schema Drift Detection**: Identify and alert on schema inconsistencies
- **Schema Documentation**: Automated schema documentation generation

#### Semi-structured Data Support
- **JSON/XML Validation**: Native support for semi-structured data formats

# Contributing to Tresto

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Tresto! We welcome contributions from the community.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for dependency management
- Node.js (for Playwright browser installation)

### Setup Steps

1. **Fork and clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Tresto.git
   cd Tresto
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   uv sync --dev
   ```

3. **Install Playwright browsers**
   ```bash
   uv run playwright install
   ```

4. **Install pre-commit hooks**
   ```bash
   uv run pre-commit install
   ```

5. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

## üß™ Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest

# Run specific test file
uv run pytest tests/test_example.py

# Run with coverage
uv run pytest --cov=src/tresto
```

## üìã Code Quality

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

### Linting and Formatting

```bash
# Run ruff for linting
uv run ruff check .

# Auto-fix issues
uv run ruff check . --fix

# Format code with black
uv run black .

# Type checking with mypy
uv run mypy .
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

Pre-commit hooks run automatically before each commit:
- Black (code formatting)
- Ruff (linting)
- MyPy (type checking)
- Pytest (basic tests)

## üöÄ Making Changes

### Branch Strategy

1. Create a feature branch from `main`
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes and commit them
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
   ```

3. Push to your fork and create a pull request
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### Commit Message Convention

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `style:` Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `test:` Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks

### Code Style Guidelines

1. **Python Code Style**
   - Follow PEP 8
   - Use type hints for all functions
   - Maximum line length: 120 characters
   - Use descriptive variable and function names

2. **Documentation**
   - Add docstrings to all public functions and classes
   - Use Google-style docstrings
   - Update README.md if adding new features

3. **Testing**
   - Write tests for new features
   - Maintain test coverage above 80%
   - Use descriptive test names

## üìù Pull Request Process

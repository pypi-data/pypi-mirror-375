ModoðŸ§¯ generates Markdown files.
These files need to be processed further to obtain an HTML site that can be served on GitHub Pages (or elsewhere).
ModoðŸ§¯ supports different formats to make this step easier, via the config field `format` or flag `--format`.

## Hugo

With format `hugo`, ModoðŸ§¯ creates a minimal [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) project,
and Markdown files with front matter and cross-references for Hugo.
The generated files can be used by Hugo without any further steps:

```shell {class="no-wrap"}
modo init hugo      # required only once to set up the project
modo build
hugo serve -s docs/site/
```

When using the default structure obtained from `modo init hugo`,
the Hugo project resides under `docs/site`.
However, Hugo's content folder `docs/site/content` is in `.gitignore`
and only contains files generated by ModoðŸ§¯.
All additional content files (like a user guide) should instead be placed under `docs/src`, as if this was the content folder.
These files are processed for [doc-tests](../features/doctests).
Besides that, the Hugo project can be used and modified as usual.

[Templates](../features/templates) can be used to customize the Hugo front matter of each page.

Hugo itself is extremely versatile and the provided setup is just
a minimal suggestion that uses the [Hextra](https://imfing.github.io/hextra/) theme.
For a more customized documentation site (using Hextra as well), see the [sources](https://github.com/mlange-42/modo/tree/main/docs) of this site.

## mdBook

With format `mdbook`, ModoðŸ§¯ creates Markdown files
as well as auxiliary files for [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook).
The generated files can be used by mdBook without any further steps:

```shell {class="no-wrap"}
modo init mdbook     # required only once to set up the project
modo build
mdbook serve docs/ --open
```

When using the default structure obtained from `modo init mdbook`,
you can edit the mdBook configuration file `book.toml` under `docs/`

Note that the mdBook format is more limited than Hugo,
as it allows only for a single package and no auxiliary documentation files.

## Plain Markdown

With format `plain`, ModoðŸ§¯ creates plain markdown files.
This is ModoðŸ§¯'s default output format.
The generated files are suitable for pushing to GitHub and GitHub's Markdown rendering.

When using the default structure obtained from `modo init plain`,
ModoðŸ§¯'s generated files are placed under `docs/site`, which is in `.gitignore`.
All additional content files (like a user guide) should be placed under `docs/src`.
As with the Hugo format, these files are processed for [doc-tests](../features/doctests).

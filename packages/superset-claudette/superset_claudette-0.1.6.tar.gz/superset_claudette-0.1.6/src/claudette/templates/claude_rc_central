# Central Claude RC file for all your claudette environments

## Claudette Project Documentation Standard

### PROJECT.md (Claudette Standard)
Each claudette worktree creates a PROJECT.md file that:
- Contains branch-specific documentation and context
- Is gitignored (not committed to the Superset repo)
- Should be loaded by Claude when present in the current directory
- Tracks the feature/branch work, not repo-wide concerns

### File Hierarchy

1. **CLAUDE.md** (Superset repo) - Repo-wide Superset development guidelines
2. **CLAUDE.local.md** (symlinked) - Shared claudette configuration for all projects
3. **PROJECT.md** (per worktree) - Branch-specific documentation and tasks
4. **~/.claude/CLAUDE.md** - Global user preferences (managed by user)

## Loading PROJECT.md

When Claude starts in a claudette project directory, it should load PROJECT.md
if present to get branch-specific context. This file contains:
- Feature overview and goals
- Implementation notes
- Testing strategy
- Current status
- Related PRs/issues

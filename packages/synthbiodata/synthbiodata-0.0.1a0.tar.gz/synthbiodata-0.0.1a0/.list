# synthbiodata

Improvements to make:

# 1. Type Annotation Issues:
The return type annotation for polars.DataFrame in generate_sample_data() is using string literal "polars.DataFrame" instead of proper type hint
Missing type annotations for some class attributes
Should use from typing import List for Python <3.9 compatibility (if that's a requirement)

# 2. Configuration Issues:
Magic numbers are used throughout the code (e.g., 0.03, 42, etc.) without clear explanation of their significance
No configuration file support (e.g., YAML or JSON) for loading default values
No environment variable support for configuration overrides
No validation for standard deviation values being positive

# 3. Error Handling:
Error messages could be more descriptive and include actual values
No custom exception classes for configuration errors
No logging implementation for configuration errors or warnings

# 4. Code Organization:
The file is quite long (174 lines) and could potentially be split into separate modules
Generator imports are circular (config imports from generator, generator likely imports from config)
Missing clear versioning for configuration schema

# 5. Testing Concerns:
The validation thresholds (e.g., 1e-6 for probability sum) should be constants
No clear way to serialize/deserialize configurations
No factory methods for common configuration scenarios

# 6. Design Issues:
The DataType enum is not extensible without code changes
No clear strategy for handling backward compatibility of configurations
No support for configuration inheritance or composition
The generate_sample_data function might be better placed in a separate module

# Best Practices Missing:
No __all__ definition to control public API
No type hints for the validator methods' self parameter
No frozen configurations option (configurations can be modified after creation)
No clear deprecation strategy for configuration parameters
Performance Considerations:
Validation is performed on every instance creation, which might be unnecessary in some cases
No caching mechanism for frequently used configurations
No lazy loading of heavy imports

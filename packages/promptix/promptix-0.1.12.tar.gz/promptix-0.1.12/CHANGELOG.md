## [0.1.11] - 2025-01-19

### ðŸš¨ BREAKING CHANGES
- **JSON format is no longer supported**: All prompt storage now uses YAML format exclusively
- Users with existing `prompts.json` files must migrate to `prompts.yaml`

### Added
- Centralized configuration management with `PromptixConfig` class
- Environment variable support for configuration (e.g., `PROMPTIX_LOG_LEVEL`, `PROMPTIX_STORAGE_FORMAT`)
- Enhanced error messages with clear migration guidance for JSON format
- Automatic detection of unsupported JSON files with helpful migration instructions
- `check_for_unsupported_files()` method to identify JSON files that need migration

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Completely removed JSON format support for prompt storage
- Standardized on YAML as the sole storage format (.yaml, .yml extensions only)
- Updated Promptix Studio to work exclusively with YAML format
- Improved configuration system with centralized path management
- Enhanced error handling with actionable user guidance
- Updated all examples and documentation to reference YAML instead of JSON
- Improved storage architecture with simplified, maintainable code

### Deprecated
- N/A (JSON format support has been completely removed)

### Removed
- `JSONPromptLoader` class and all JSON handling code
- Support for `prompts.json` files (users must migrate to `prompts.yaml`)
- Dual-format confusion by eliminating JSON/YAML mixed support
- Legacy JSON fallback mechanisms in Promptix Studio

### Fixed
- Version consistency: synchronized version 0.1.11 across `pyproject.toml` and `__init__.py`
- Storage format confusion by eliminating dual YAML/JSON support
- Configuration management with centralized, environment-aware settings
- Error messages now provide clear, actionable migration guidance

### Migration Guide
**For users with existing `prompts.json` files:**

1. **Rename your file**: `mv prompts.json prompts.yaml`
2. **Verify YAML syntax**: Ensure your content follows proper YAML format
3. **Test your setup**: Run your application to verify the migration worked
4. **Remove old file**: Delete the old `prompts.json` file

**Error messages will guide you through this process if JSON files are detected.**

### Technical Improvements
- Simplified codebase by removing JSON loader complexity
- Better separation of concerns with centralized configuration
- Enhanced logging and error reporting
- Improved test coverage for YAML-only functionality

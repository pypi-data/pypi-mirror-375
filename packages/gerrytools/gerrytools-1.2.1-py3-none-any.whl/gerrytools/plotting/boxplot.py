    r"""
    Plot boxplots, which takes `scores` â€” a dictionary where each value
    (corresponding to an ensemble, citizens' ensemble, or proposed plans),
    will be a list of lists, where each sublist will be its own box. Proposed
    scores will be plotted as colored circles on their respective box. Color the
    boxplots conditioned on the kind of the scores (ensemble or citizen), and
    trim each sublist to only the values between the specified percentiles.

    Args:
        ax (Axes): `Axes` object on which the boxplots are plotted.
        scores (dict): Dictionary with keys of `ensemble`, `citizen`, `proposed`
            which map to lists of numerical scores.
        proposed_info (dict, optional): Dictionary with keys of `colors`, `names`;
            the \(i\)th color in `color` corresponds to the \(i\)th name in `names`.
        percentiles (tuple, optional): Observations outside this range of
            percentiles are ignored. Defaults to `(1, 99)`, such that observations
            between the 1st and 99th percentiles (inclusive) are included, and
            all others are ignored.
        rotation (float, optional): Tick labels are rotated `rotation` degrees
            _counterclockwise_.
        ticksize (float, optional): Font size for tick labels.
        jitter (float, optional): When there is more than one proposed plan,
            adjust its detail points by a value drawn from \(\mathcal U (-\epsilon,
            \epsilon)\) where \(\epsilon = \) `jitter`.
        labels (list, optional): x- and y-axis labels, if desired.
        xticklabels (list, optional): Labels for the boxes, default to integers.

    Returns:
        `Axes` object on which the violins are plotted.

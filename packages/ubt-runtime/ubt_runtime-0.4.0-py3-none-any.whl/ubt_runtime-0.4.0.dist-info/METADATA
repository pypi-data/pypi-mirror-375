# Shared ubCode pyarmor runtime

Shared pyarmor runtime as per
https://pyarmor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/man.html#pyarmor-gen-runtime

# Build shared runtime

Call

	rye run runtime:generate

# Register pyarmor license

Pyarmor needs a license to run. It must be registered on the individual machines and in the CI.
Call

	rye run license:register

to register the license on the current machine. It will check if the license is already registered and
register it if not.

# codesign for macOS

When building the package on Linux, the codesign command is not available:

	WARNING  codesign command failed with:
	[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'codesign'

Check how to fix this issue, either by postponing the codesign command to a MacOS user or by generating
the whole runtime package on MacOS.

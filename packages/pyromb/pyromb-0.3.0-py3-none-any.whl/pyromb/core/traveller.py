    """The Traveller walks through the catchment, proceeding from the very most upstream
    basin to the outfall location. 

    The walk is performed in a breadth first manner processing all the upstream catchments
    first, then walking down till it finds a confluence and jumps back up to the most
    upstream sub-basin. So that RORB can be built correctly, the traveller has the option to 
    pause on the confluence before proceeding to the next upstream reach. This allows for a 
    save step to be performed in the RORB model. WBNM does not require such a step.

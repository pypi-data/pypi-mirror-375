## What is it?
Pyobis is an interesting python package that helps users fetch data from OBIS API which
harvests occurrence records from thousands of datasets and makes them available as a
single integrated dataset.

[The Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS)](https://obis.org) is a global open-access data and
information clearing-house on marine biodiversity for science, conservation, and sustainable
development, maintained by IOOS.

Other OBIS clients:

+ R: `robis`, [iobis/robis](https://github.com/iobis/robis)

## Main Features
Here are just a few of things pyOBIS can do:

+ Easy handling of OBIS data, easy fetching without handling the raw API response directly.
+ Built-in functions for `occurrence`, `taxon`, `node`, `checklist` and `dataset` endpoints of OBIS API.
+ Provides easy export of data to `Pandas` DataFrame, and helps researchers focus more on analysis rather than data mining.

For examples of how to use this repo, see the jupyter notebooks in the `/notebooks/` directory.
NOTE: GitHub's jupyter notebook display does not show interactive plots; open the notebooks in a jupyter hub (eg colab, binder, etc) for the full experience.

## Installation

### Install from PyPI

```bash
pip install pyobis
```
### Install from conda-forge

Installing pyobis from the conda-forge channel can be achieved by adding conda-forge to your channels with:

```bash
conda install pyobis --channel conda-forge
```

## Usage

```python
from pyobis import occurrences

# Search for occurrences
query = occurrences.search(scientificname="Mola mola")
data = query.execute()

# Get occurrence by ID
query = occurrences.get(id="00003cf7-f2fc-4c53-98a6-7d846e70f5d1")
data = query.execute()
```

## Library API

`pyobis` is split up into modules for each of the groups of API methods.

+ `checklist` - Checklist. Generate a checklist of species under a taxa, IUCN Red List, or most recently added species.
+ `dataset` - Dataset. Get metadata of datasets (including `datasetid`, `owner`, `institution`, `number of records`, etc) for a queried spatiotemporal region or taxa.
+ `nodes` - Nodes. Get records or activities for an OBIS node.
+ `occurrences` - Occurrence. Fetch occurrence records, geopoints, lookup for a `scientificname`, extensions (e.g. DNADerivedData, MeasurementOrFacts, etc.)
+ `taxa` - Taxonomic names. Get taxon records with `taxonid` or `scientificname`, and scientific name annotations by the WoRMS team.

You can import the entire library, or each module individually as needed.

## Usage Guide

For a detailed usage guide with information about inputs, output and module functions please read the [Usage Guide](notebooks/usage_guide.ipynb)

## Sample analysis

Some Jupyter Notebook based sample analysis and visualization of data grabbed through `pyobis` have been made available through `/notebooks/` directory.
To get full experience of the interactive plots (eg. geoplots, etc) please open notebooks in a Jupyter Hub (eg. through Google Colab, Binder, local installation, etc.)

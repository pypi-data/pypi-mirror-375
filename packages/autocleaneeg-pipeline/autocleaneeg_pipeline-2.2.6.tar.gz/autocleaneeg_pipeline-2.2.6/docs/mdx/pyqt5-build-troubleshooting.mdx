# Troubleshooting PyQt5 Build Issues on Linux

<Steps>

### 1. Diagnose the Hang

PyQt5 version **5.15.2** lacks a pre-built wheel for Python 3.11, causing `uv` to compile from source and appear to hang during installation.

### 2. Pin a Compatible Version

Updated `pyproject.toml` to require `PyQt5>=5.15.11`, ensuring `uv` downloads a pre-built wheel instead of compiling the library.

### 3. Reinstall the Tool

```bash
uv tool install -e --upgrade .
```

### 4. Verify the Fix

Installation should now complete without the prolonged build step.

</Steps>

<Callout>
If the build still compiles from source, confirm Python is 3.11+ and that the package cache is cleared (`uv clean`).
</Callout>

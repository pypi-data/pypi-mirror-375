**Unlock your Geekbot data within your LLM applications üöÄ**

Geekbot MCP (Model Context Protocol) server acts as a bridge, connecting LLM client applications (like Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) directly to your Geekbot workspace. This allows you to interact with your standups, reports, and team members seamlessly within your conversations using natural language.

## Key Features ‚ú®

- **Access Standup and Poll Information**: List all standups and polls in your Geekbot workspace. üìä
- **Retrieve Standup Reports and Poll Results**: Fetch reports and poll results with filters for specific standups, users, or date ranges. üìÑ
- **View Team Members**: Get a list of members you collaborate with in Geekbot. üë•
- **Post Standup Reports**: Post a standup report to Geekbot. üìù

## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

After installling Geekbot MCP, you can connect it to your an LLM client desktop application (e.g., Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.):

1. **Get your Geekbot API Key:** Find it in your [Geekbot API/Webhooks settings](https://geekbot.com/dashboard/api-webhooks) üîë.

2. **Find your `uv` executable path:**

- **Linux/macOS:**
  In your terminal, run the following command:

  ```bash
    which uv
  ```

- **Windows:**
  In your PowerShell, run the following command:

  ```powershell
    (Get-Command uv | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Path) -replace '\\', '\\'
  ```

3. **Configure your LLM client desktop application:**
Each LLM client that supports MCP provides a configuration file that you can edit to add Geekbot MCP server.
- [Claude Desktop](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user)
- [Cursor](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol)
- [Windsurf](https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/cascade/mcp)

If you are using a different LLM client, please refer to the documentation of your client to learn how to configure the MCP server.

After you locate the configuration file, edit it to add Geekbot MCP server:

```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "geekbot-mcp": {
          "command": "UV-PATH",
          "args": [
            "tool",
            "run",
            "geekbot-mcp"
          ],
          "env": {
            "GB_API_KEY": "YOUR-API-KEY"
          }
        }
      }
    }
```

Make sure to replace:
  - `UV-PATH` with the path to your `uv` executable from step 2
  - `YOUR-API-KEY` with your Geekbot API key from step 1

### Prompts üí¨

**`weekly_rollup_report`**

**Purpose:** Generates a comprehensive weekly rollup report that summarizes team standup responses, highlights key updates, identifies risks and mitigation strategies, outlines next steps, and tracks upcoming launches.


### Tips üí°

- **Review Tool Usage**: Make the agent ask for your explicit approval for each tool action and not allow automatic tool calls. This safety feature ensures you maintain control over sensitive operations, particularly when posting reports to Geekbot. You'll be prompted to review and approve each tool call before execution, helping prevent unintended data submissions.

- **Ask for preview**: Before posting a report, ask the agent to preview the report and not actually post it. This will give you a chance to review the report and make sure it is correct or make changes to it before posting it to Geekbot.

- **Limit the volume of retrieved data**: If you are using the `fetch_reports` tool, limit the date range to a reasonable period. This will help prevent the agent from retrieving a large amount of data and causing performance issues. Have in mind that the agent will apply limits in the number of reports it can retrieve.

**Arguments:**

- `standup_id`: ID of the standup to include in the rollup report.

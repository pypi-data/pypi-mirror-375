# voice_code Project
  This is an IDE for python.
  All paid features are enabled in this version. The quality of your experience may vary based on the server's current workload.

## Key Advantages:
  For the first time, bugs are identified by monitoring the entire program execution process. This is a new starting point.
  
  For the first time, the innovative MouseClick Pickup, VoicePhrase, and VoiceSimilarWords technologies to enable text input, surpassing the speed of traditional keyboard typing.
  Real-time fine-tuning based on individual voice models.
  Real-time automatic fine-tuning will be added, more use, sharper voice accuracy.
  For barrier-free input, please use the 'a f k p u' key and move the mouse up, down, left, right and standstill .


## Supported Platforms Now

- **Operating Systems**
  - MacOS M1-M4

- **Python Versions**
  - Python 3.9
  - Python 3.10
  - Python 3.11
  - Python 3.12
  - Python 3.13

## Version differences
  You can turn off word-level speech recognition in the menu bar - mode - Stop word-level speech recognition 05

## Installation

```sh

brew install portaudio
pip3 install voice_code / pip3 install voice_code -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple

Use 'pip3 show voice_code' to find the 'site-packages' folder.
Locate 'voice_code_resource' folder in 'site-packages' and run the main.py inside. Wait for automatic registration success information and it will generate a 'voice coding' icon inside the voice_code_resource folder.
Move 'voice coding' icon to your desktop or any other folder. From now on, you can run voice_code by double-clicking this icon.

```

## Usage
  
Open the software menu bar to view more detailed instructions.

For the first time you have to run 'voice_code' in terminal, after that there will be an icon in folder:voice_code_resource, you can drag the icon to any location to open voice_code by double clicking it.

For voice input:
  Download vosk-model-en-us-0.22-lgraph from https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models 
  Move vosk-model-en-us-0.22-lgraph into site-packages/voice_code_resource/Easy_Code_res

  Open your program folder and click (menu bar) -other - create words to short_words and check_worsd.txt to automatically collect words you used.
  Click (menu bar) -other - collect similar words... and then read the words, it will automatically create similar words dict and save. You can whisper as you collect similar words.
  Then you can enjoy inputing by voice now,You can whisper. please watch my videos for more detailed steps if any doubt.

  When using voice input, each time you click to correct the voice recognition result, you can choose to record the correction result, which will instantly fine-tune the using voice model.

For operation:
  In theory, all operations can be performed without the keyboard, except for some recently added functions.

  You can enter punctuation marks by clicking the middle button of the mouse on blank areas of the canvas. The corresponding punctuation marks will be displayed when the mouse moves to different positions. 
  You can add punctuation marks or delete them by right clicking on different positions of the current editing line. This operation is only valid for the current editing line.
  All punctuation input is covered by mouse operations.

  Move the mouse to the code line and click the middle button to pick up the code at the middle button to the current editing position. 
  Move the cursor upward from the bottom of the code line and downward from the top to enter the code line, different text ranges will be highlighted.

For Debug Agent:
  For 'ask ai' button, to get a quick reply, you need to fill in your own ai model account to use ask ai.
  Otherwise, it will consume the usage count of debug mode.

  For 'debug agent' button, it will use its own server without using your ai model account. 
  This function will collect running parameters and requires your help to run the code.

  The smoothness of operation and voice recognition speed are heavily influenced by computer performance.

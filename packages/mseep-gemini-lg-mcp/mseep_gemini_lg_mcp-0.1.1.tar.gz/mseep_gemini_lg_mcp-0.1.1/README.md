## What it does

- **Smart search strategies** - Generates multiple optimized search queries
- **Iterative research** - Follows up on knowledge gaps automatically using LangGraph
- **Citation tracking** - Preserves source URLs and references
- **Structured output** - Returns organized research data for easy use

Perfect for research, fact-checking, market analysis, competitive intelligence, and staying current on any topic.

## Quick Start

### 1. Get a Gemini API Key
Get your free API key at: https://aistudio.google.com/app/prompts/new_chat

### 2. Add to Cursor / Claude Desktop

Add the following to your `.cursor/mcp.json` file or Claude Desktop `mcp.json` file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gemini-research": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "git+https://github.com/albinjal/gemini-lg-mcp.git", "python", "-m", "src.server"],
      "env": {
        "GEMINI_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Your client might not be able to find `uvx`. In that case run `which uvx` to find the path to `uvx` and add replace the `command` with the path to `uvx`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gemini-research": {
      "command": "<output from which uvx>",
      "args": ["--from", "git+https://github.com/albinjal/gemini-lg-mcp.git", "python", "-m", "src.server"],
      "env": {
        "GEMINI_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```bash
pip install FinToolsAP
```

## LocalDatabase

### Database Overview

The LocalDatabase module is a Python wrapper over a SQLite database. Because the backend of the Database
is SQL, much more targeted querying and big data operations are possible compared to storing data as
a `csv` or parquet file, but still allows for easy querying via Python. Additionally, sharing large 
databases is tantamount to sharing a couple of Python files. 

The database file structure is organized as follows:

- Database.db
- DatabaseContents.py
- ExtraScripts
- FILEStoDB
- CreateTables

#### Database.db

This is the SQLite database that stores the data.

#### DatabaseContents.py

This file lists all of the tables, variables, and data types in the Database. This file is core to the Database, and without it or if it is improperly specified, the operation of the Database will be severely affected. 

The file is organized as several Python classes that contain several member variables. There are two types of 
classes: (1) `Tables` and (2) user-specified classes. **The `Tables` class must be present in the `DatabaseContents.py` 
file for the Database to be operational.** It lists what files to run and download to construct the Database. 
It is structured as

```python
class Tables:

    # The order indicates the order in which data is added to the Database

    # 1. ExtraScripts/ 
    # list of tables added using ExtraScripts/
    EXTRA_TABLES = ['IBES_LTG']

    # 2. FILEStoDB/
    # list of tables to read in from FILEStoDB/
    FILES_TABLES = ['CRSP_DAILY.csv']

    # 3. WRDS
    # list of tables to download from WRDS
    WRDS_USERNAME = <your_username>
    WRDS_TABLES = ['CRSP.MSF'] 

    # 4. Cleaning
    # additional cleaning operations to be applied to data
    # format {'tablename': {'operation': ['columns']}}
    SQL_CLEANING = {'CRSP_DAILY': {'drop_null_rows': ['permco']}}

    # 5. CREATED TABLES
    # list of created tables using scripts in CreateTables/
    CREATED_TABLES = ['CRSP']
```

Each of the lists in the `Tables` class tells either what file to download, import, or create. The files are run in the order of the tables. 
Specifically, the order is always `EXTRA_TABLES -> FILES_TABLES -> WRDS_TABLES -> SQL_CLEANING -> CREATED_TABLES`. The idea is that all of the 
raw data is imported and cleaned before creating new tables with data that is in the Database. Note: As part of the SQL cleaning, all of the 
empty values imported are explicitly cast to `NULL`; this helps with automatic data typing. 

Each of the lists should contain the name of the files or data tables to import. The files are then imported in the order they appear in the 
list. Note

Specifically, in the example above, at the initialization of the constructor for the Database, the Database will first look in the `ExtraScripts` folder 
for a file named `IBES_LTG.py`. It will execute this file, then move on to looking in the `FILEStoDB` for a file named `CRSP_DAILY.csv` and so on. Files
from WRDS are downloaded using the `wrds` Python package. Specific SQL cleaning is applied to specific columns if specified. Finally, the files in `CREATED_TABLES`
are run. 

The database first checks that the table is not present in the Database before executing or importing any of the files in the `Tables` class. Additionally, 
the names in the list are the only tables imported to the Database. For example, if the `CreateTables` contains multiple files, only the names present in the 
`CREATED_TABLES` list will be run during database initialization. 

The second type of table in the `DatabaseContents.py` file is specific tables that can be queried from the Database. These tables take the form.

```python
class LINKTABLE:

    TABLE = 'LINKTABLE'

    DEFAULT_ID = 'id'
    DEFAULT_DATE = 'date'

    DEFAULT_VARS = ['wficn', 'date', 'value']

    VARS_DATA_TYPE = {
                      'id': 'Int64', 'date': 'datetime64[ns]', 'type': str, 'value': float
 }
```

Each of these classes must contain the following member variables: `TABLE`, `DEFAULT_ID`, `DEFAULT_DATE`, `DEFAULT_VARS`, and `VARS_DATA_TYPE`. Additional, 
`DEFAULT`s can be added to specify further querying defaults. See [Querying Data from the Database](#QueryingDatafromtheDatabase)

The `TABLE` member is the name of the table in the SQL database, and additional matches either the file
in `ExtraScripts` or `CreatedTables`, or it is the name of the `csv` file that was imported. Tables downloaded from WRDS will have similar names to their names in 
the WRDS backend, but with `.` replaced with `_`. For example, `CRSP.MSF` will have a table name of `CRSP_MSF`. 

`DEFAULT_ID` and `DEFAULT_DATE` let the Database know that those are the column identifiers for the primary `id` and `date` for the table. This allows for additional filtering and sorting on these columns. `DEFAULT_VARS` are queried from the Database if no specific columns are specified. `VARS_DATA_TYPE` 
specifies all of the columns and their
data types in the table. These types are used to cast data when querying from the data at runtime. It is not required to fill out all of the types for the Database to function, but
automatic type casting will be affected. 

When tables are added to the Database, the Database will automatically write each table's class to the `DatabaseContents.py` file. The name of the class and of the table default to 
the name of the file that created the table. `DEFAULT_ID`, `DEFAULT_DATE`, and `DEFAULT_VARS` are left blank; **they do not need to be specified for database operation, but if they
are not, then the operation of the Database will be affected.** When the Database writes `VARS_DATA_TYPE`, it will use the datatype from the SQL that is the loosest. 

The organization of individual table classes can take several forms. For example, the following gives an example of grouping by data vendors.

```python
class DataVendor1:

    class Table1:

        TABLE = 'TABLE1'

        DEFAULT_ID = None
        DEFAULT_DATE = None

        DEFAULT_VARS = []

        VARS_DATA_TYPE = {
                          'id': 'Int64', 'date': 'datetime64[ns]', 'type': str, 'value': float
 }

    class Table2:

        class Table2:

        TABLE = 'TABLE2'

        DEFAULT_ID = None
        DEFAULT_DATE = None

        DEFAULT_VARS = []

        VARS_DATA_TYPE = {
                          'id': 'Int64', 'date': 'datetime64[ns]', 'id2': str, 'county': str
 }
```

#### ExtraScripts 

This folder is used to take data that cannot be imported into the Database by other methods. These scripts are helpful
when trying to import data to the Database if the given data is not a `csv`, downloaded from WRDS, or there is a specific 
issue in the data that needs to be handled before importing to the dataframe. Writes to the Database are done via pandas or 
polars SQL write functions.

A table typically fails to be read into the Database because it has a mixed type in one of the columns, causing the error. So files in the `ExtraScripts/` folder are helpful when trying to cast the entire dataframe to one type.

For example, the IBES Long Term Growth dataset (fpi = 0) from WRDS cannot be loaded into the dataframe because it has a mixed type.
So, I use an "ExtraScript" to cast the entire dataframe into a string type and load it into the Database from this file. Below is an example of how to handle the situation described above.

```python
## DO NOT MODIFY

import sys
import pathlib
import sqlalchemy
import importlib.util

PATH_TO_DB = sys.argv[1]
PATH_TO_DBC = pathlib.Path(PATH_TO_DB).parent / 'DatabaseContents.py'

spec = importlib.util.spec_from_file_location('DBC', str(PATH_TO_DBC))
DBC = importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec)
spec.loader.exec_module(DBC)

# connection for connectorx (reading) and polars.write_database
# for polars.DataFrame.
DB_CONNECTION = f'sqlite:///{PATH_TO_DB}'

# sql engine for writing pandas.DataFrame. Additionally, 
# pandas.read_sql can be used for reading from the database
# using the sql engine. However this it is slower and more
# memory inefficient than connectorx
SQL_ENGINE = sqlalchemy.create_engine(DB_CONNECTION)

############################################################################
# Your Code Below

import pandas

PATH_TO_STUBBORN_FILE = pathlib.Path('~/Documents/FullDB/FILEStoDB')
ltg = pandas.read_csv(PATH_TO_STUBBORN_FILE / 'IBES_LTG.csv', low_memory = False)
ltg = ltg.astype(str)
ltg.to_sql('IBES_LTG', con = SQL_ENGINE, index = False)
```
The resulting table in the Database will be named `IBES_LTG`. **The name of the file needs to be `IBES_LTG.py`. See [DatabaseContents.py](#databasecontents.py) for an explanation on file naming.

#### FILEStoDB

This folder is where to place `csv` files that should be imported to the Database. These files are imported using the following script that adds the file to the 
SQL database

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# import_csv.sh  —  fast CSV → SQLite loader
# Usage: ./import_csv.sh /path/to/db.sqlite /path/to/data.csv target_table

set -euo pipefail

DB_PATH="${1:?missing database path}"
CSV_PATH="${2:?missing CSV path}"
TABLE="${3:?missing table name}"

sqlite3 "$DB_PATH" <<SQL
-- Silence the “off” echoed by the PRAGMAs
.output /dev/null
PRAGMA journal_mode = OFF;
PRAGMA synchronous  = OFF;
.output stdout

-- Import the CSV (expects header row)
.mode csv
.import '$CSV_PATH' $TABLE
.mode columns
.quit
SQL
```

Journal modes and synchronous are set to off to increase writing speeds. As the Database is only operated on by one process at a time, this is a safe setting. 

#### WRDS_TABLES

The `WRDS_TABLES` member of the `Tables` class in the `DatabaseContents.py` file specifies which tables to download from Wharton Research Data Services. This requires a 
valid WRDS username. On first run, the `wrds` package will prompt for a password and then will ask if you want to create a `.pgpass` file. This is handled by the `wrds` Python
package; select yes to save your password for future queries. 

To find the names of the tables that can be downloaded from WRDS, go to the SAS Studio section of the WRDS interface. 

#### CreateTables

This folder contains several Python files that are run each time the Database is initialized. These files take data that is currently within the Database and create new tables or modify existing tables with the 
database. 

These files are very similar to the `ExtraScripts` files. However, data read by these files should come from the Database. To read 
data in from the Database, use SQL commands. For example, this file reads in three raw files from the Database using `connectorx`, merges them, and then writes them back to the Database.

```python
## DO NOT MODIFY

import sys
import pathlib
import sqlalchemy
import importlib.util

PATH_TO_DB = sys.argv[1]
PATH_TO_DBC = pathlib.Path(PATH_TO_DB).parent / 'DatabaseContents.py'

spec = importlib.util.spec_from_file_location('DBC', str(PATH_TO_DBC))
DBC = importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec)
spec.loader.exec_module(DBC)

# connection for connectorx (reading) and polars.write_database
# for polars.DataFrame.
DB_CONNECTION = f'sqlite:///{PATH_TO_DB}'

# sql engine for writing pandas.DataFrame. Additionally, 
# pandas.read_sql can be used for reading from the database
# using the sql engine. However this it is slower and more
# memory inefficient than connectorx
SQL_ENGINE = sqlalchemy.create_engine(DB_CONNECTION)

import connectorx

# ---- read in data ----

mflink1 = connectorx.read_sql(conn = DB_CONNECTION,
                              query = """SELECT * FROM MFL_MFLINK1"""
 )

# Thompson Reuters information
mflink2 = connectorx.read_sql(conn = DB_CONNECTION,
                              query = """SELECT * FROM MFL_MFLINK2"""
 )

# crsp owner codes

                              query = """SELECT * FROM MFL_MFLINK3"""
 )

mflink1 = mflink1.merge(mflink3, how = 'left', on = ['wficn', 'crsp_fundno'])

# merge on Thompson Reuters mutual fund information (mflink2)
# mflink2 has 2,461,771 nan wficns out of 3,116,553 observations
# mflink1 has no wficns that aren't in mflink2 => left join on mflink2
mflink = mflink2.merge(mflink1, how = 'left', on = ['wficn'])

# ---- write data ----
mflink.to_sql('MFLINKS', 
              con = SQL_ENGINE, 
              if_exists = 'replace', 
              index = False
)
```

### Initializing a New Database

When a new database is first initialized, the file structure described above will be created at the specified path. Then a warning message about adding to the `DatabaseContents.py` file will be displayed. The Database will not operate until data is added to the `DatabaseContents.py` file. In the `ExtraScripts` and the `CreateTables` folder, there will be an example version of each of those files that can be used as templates.

Once a database is initialized, then every time the constructor of the Database is run, the Database will check the `DatabaseContents.py` file for all of the tables that are specified in the file. If all of the tables are present, then the Database will initialize instantly; if not, the Database will attempt to add the new tables. The files used to create the Database can crash, and in that case, the initialization of the Database will also crash. 

Below is an example output of a successful database initialization when adding one `csv` file to the Database. Note that the data is first imported, then cleaned, then the SQL types are inferred, and the output is written to the `DatabaseContents.py` file. Then the Ken French industry classifications are downloaded. 

```python
Adding TESTDB/FILEStoDB/CRSP_MONTHLY.csv to SQL database TESTDB.db...

### Adding Data to the Database

Adding data to the Database involves either running a script in `ExtraScripts` or `CreatedTables`, importing a `csv` file in `FILEStoDB`, or downloading
a table from WRDS. 

Large files should be imported using the `FILEStoDB` method because this avoids RAM, and therefore, large datasets can be imported without running into memory issues. 

When working in the `CreateTables` files, you have direct access to the SQL database. This means you can run SQL commands to modify the data. If the data is extensive, this can be beneficial to avoid memory issues. 

### Deleting Data from the Database

To delete tables from the Database, use the keywords `update_all_tables`, `update_created_tables`, or `tables_to_update` in the `LocalDatabase`
constructor. 

For example, to delete a specific table in the Database

```python
import FinToolsAP.LocalDatabase as FTDB

DB = FTDB.LocalDatabase('path/to/database', tables_to_update = ['Table1'])
```

### Querying Data from the Database

To query from the Database, use the `queryDB` function. This function allows for various levels of filtering of the data, only to load 
the wanted columns. This is very useful when the data is extensive. For example, to query data use

```python
import FinToolsAP.LocalDatabase as FTDB

DB = FTDB.LocalDatabase('path/to/database')
df = DB.queryDB(DB.DBC.LINKTABLE)
```

This snippet will query the default vars from `LINKTABLE` in the `DatabaseContents.py` file. `DB.DBC.LINKTABLE` is a direct reference to the class in the `DatabaseContents.py` file. You
can specify a string instead of the direct reference if you need to load tables programmatically; change `DB.DBC.LINKTABLE` to the literal string `'DB.DBC.LINKTABLE'`. 

The query function allows for various filtering. Say you want to query only data for `id`s of `type` A. Then, the query would be 

```python
df = DB.queryDB(DB.DBC.LINKTABLE, id = 'A')
```
filtering can be completed on any column in the dataframe. This includes passing a list for multiple types, for example, 

```python
df = DB.queryDB(DB.DBC.LINKTABLE, id = ['A', 'B'])
```

To use the keywords `start_date` and `end_date`, the `DEFAULT_DATE` for that specific table must be specified. If it is left as `None`, then the date filtering will not work.

### Fama French Industry Classification Codes

Additionally, the Database downloads the Fama-French Industry classification codes from Ken French's data repository. Each classification level 
is downloaded. To access the Fama-French classifications, use

```python
import FinToolsAP.LocalDatabase as FTDB

DB = FTDB.LocalDatabase('path/to/database')
DB.getFFIndustryClassification(2040, level = 49, info = 'desc')
```

This snippet gets the industry description for SIC code 2040 when the classification level is 49. 

## WebData

The WebData module uses the `wrds` package to download data from WRDS at runtime and creates various common stock-level characteristics that are used in the empirical asset pricing literature. 

Below is a list of variables that can be loaded into a `pandas` dataframe. Data is loaded from a combination of CRSP and Compustat.

```python
'ticker': 'Ticker',
'date': 'Date',
'permco': 'PERMCO',
'comnam': 'Company Name',
'cusip': 'CUSIP',
'hsiccd': 'SIC Code',
'shrcd': 'Share Code',
'exchcd': 'Exchange Code',
'prc': 'Price',
'me': 'Market equity (millions)',
'shrout': 'Shares outstanding',
'ret': 'Return',
'retx': 'Return sans dividends',
'bidlo': 'Low price. For monthly data, this is the lowest price of the month. For daily data, this is the lowest price of the day',
'askhi': 'Hi price. For monthly data, this is the highest price of the month. For daily data, this is the highest price of the day',
'vol': 'Volume',
'div': 'Dividend amount. Calculated as the difference between the return and the return sans dividends',
'dp': 'Dividend yield. Calculated as a rolling yearly sum of dividends divided by the share price',
'dps': 'Dividend per share. Calculated as a rolling yearly sum of dividends divided by shares outstanding',
'pps': 'Price per share',
'be': 'Book Equity',
'earn': 'Earnings',
'atq': 'Total Assets',
'ltq': 'Total Liabilities',
'bm': 'Book to Market',
'bps': 'Book equity to share',
'ep': 'Earnings to price. Calculated as a rolling yearly sum of earnings divided by the market equity.',
'eps': 'Earnings per share',
'spindx': 'CRSP S&P 500 index',
'sprtrn': 'CRSP S&P 500 index return',
'vwretd': 'CRSP value weighted index return',
'vwretx': 'CRSP value weighted index return sans dividends',
'ewretd': 'CRSP equal weighted index return',
'ewretx': 'CRSP equal weighted index return sans dividends',
'totval': 'Nominal value of the CRSP indices',
'totcnt': 'Number of firms in the CRSP indices'
```

Data can only be queried by searching for specific `ticker`s. Accounting data is front-filled to construct a final time series of monthly or daily frequency using quarterly Compustat data.

For example, if we want to load all of the variables 
listed above at a monthly frequency and plot Book-to-Market for Apple. Inc we use

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import FinToolsAP.WebData as FTWD

WD = FTWD.WebData('<your WRDS username>')
df = WD.getData(tickers = ['AAPL'])
df = df.set_index('date')
ax = df.bm.plot()
ax.set_xlabel('Date')
ax.set_ylabel('Book-to-Market')
ax.set_title('Apple')
plt.show()
```

![FinToolsAP Workflow](readme_assets/apple_webdata.png)

*Figure 1: Apple Inc. Book-to-Market ratio constructed at a monthly frequency by the `FinToolsAP.WebData` module.*

Data can also be constructed at a daily level. Loading and plotting the Dividend-Yield of General Electric
between 2000-01-01 and 2010-01-01 at a daily frequency.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import FinToolsAP.WebData as FTWD

WD = FTWD.WebData('<your WRDS username>')
df = WD.getData(tickers = ['GE'], 
                fields = ['dp'], 
                start_date = '2000-01-01', 
                end_date = '2010-01-01', 
                freq = 'D')
df = df.set_index('date')
ax = df.dp.plot()
ax.set_xlabel('Date')
ax.set_ylabel('Dividend Yield')
ax.set_title('General Electric')
plt.show()
```
![FinToolsAP Workflow](readme_assets/ge_webdata.png)

**Note: All of the data loading and processing happens in memory, so overly large queries will quickly consume all of the system resources**

## UtilityFunctions

The UtilityFunctions module provides several functions that are commonly used
while working with data. These functions are mainly wrappers on pandas/numpy routines and their equivalent Polars counterparts. The wrappers provide quality of life improvements, allowing for flexible inputs and simple output for common operations. 

### Plotting a time series of the number of unique identifiers

Given a panel dataframe (either pandas or polars) with unique identifiers over time, count the number of identifiers over time and make a plot.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import FinToolsAP.UtilityFunctions as FTUF

count_over_time = FTUF.group_nunique(
    df = df,
    gr = 'date',
    vr = 'id',
    no_merge = True,
    set_index = 'date'
)
count_over_time['id'].plot()
```

This call creates a new dataframe with a single column named `id` and the index set to `date`. The `no_merge` option returns the result 
as a standalone dataframe. If the option is set to `False`, then the resulting dataframe is merged back to the original dataframe on `gr`, in this case `date`, and then the resulting dataframe's index is set to `date`. By default, `no_merge = False` and `set_index = None`. 

Similar functions exist for taking averages (weighted or unweighted), computing sums, and producing quantiles.

### Computing averages over groups. 

Given a panel dataframe (either pandas or polars) with unique identifiers over time, compute the average of `var1` and `var2` weighted by `weight`
within group `type` and `date`. 

```python
import FinToolsAP.UtilityFunctions as FTUF

df = FTUF.group_avg(
    df = df,
    gr = ['date', 'type'],
    vr = ['var1', 'var2'],
    wt = 'weight'
)
```

This call will merge columns to df on `gr `. The names will be autogenerated by pandas' or polars' default when merging when columns have the same name. 
To specify the names of the columns, pass the `name` keyword. If passing a string, that string will be appended to the column names of the averages. For example,

```python
import pandas

df = pandas.DataFrame({
    'date': pandas.to_datetime(['2021-01-01', '2021-01-01', '2021-01-02', '2021-01-02', '2021-01-03', '2021-01-03']),
    'type':      [1,                2,                1,                2,                1,                2],
    'var1':   [10.0,             20.0,             15.0,             25.0,             30.0,             35.0],
    'var2': [100,              200,              150,              250,              300,              350]
})
print(df)

#         date  type   var1  var2
# 0 2021-01-01     1 10.000   100

This calculates the equal-weighted average over time and appends `_avg` to the columns. To directly specify a new name, pass a dictionary 
```{'old_name': 'new_name'}```. For example, 

```python
df = FTUF.group_avg(
    df = df,
    gr = 'type',
    vr = ['var1', 'var2'],
    name = {'var1': 'var1_eqweight_average'},
)
print(df)

#         date  type   var1  var2_x  var1_eqweight_average  var2_y
# 0 2021-01-01     1 10.000     100                 18.333 183.333
# 1 2021-01-01     2 20.000     200                 26.667 266.667
# 2 2021-01-02     1 15.000     150                 18.333 183.333
# 3 2021-01-02     2 25.000     250                 26.667 266.667
# 4 2021-01-03     1 30.000     300                 18.333 183.333
# 5 2021-01-03     2 35.000     350                 26.667 266.667
```

Because no name was passed for ```var2```, it was named by ```pandas.merge```.

## FactorModels

`FactorModels` is a collection of Python utilities for empirical asset-pricing research. The module
provides ready-to-go functions for 

- Mean-Variance Construction:
    - Tangency (Maximum Sharpe Ratio) Portfolio
    - Global Minimum Variance Portfolio  
    - Efficient Frontier and Capital Market Line
- Two-pass/Fama-MacBeth regressions
    - Builds off the `linearmodels.asset_pricing` package
    - Uses either 2 Stage Least Squares (2SLS) or Generalized Method of Moments
    - Returns a convenient Fama-MacBeth results object that includes
        - Risk premia estimates with significance values
        - Asset level estimates of alpha, beta, $R^2$, and covariance matrix
        - Pretty-printing to drop right into LaTeX tables

### Mean-Variance and Efficient Frontier

```python
import pandas
import FinToolsAP.FactorModels as FTFM

# monthly total‑return matrix (T × N)
returns = pandas.read_csv("data/asset_returns.csv", index_col=0, parse_dates=True)
rf = 0.02 / 12  # annual 2% → monthly

# Optimal weights
w_tan = FTFM.tangency_portfolio(returns, risk_free_rate=rf)
w_gmv = FTFM.minimum_variance_portfolio(returns)

# Frontier & CML
mu, sigma, frontier, cml, (sig_T, mu_T), (sig_GMV, mu_GMV), weights = \
    FTFM.create_efficient_frontier(returns, rf=rf)
```

### Fama-MacBeth Regressions

```python
import numpy
import pandas
import FinToolsAP.FactorModels as FTFM

T = 600
N = 50
K = 10

numpy.random.seed(0)

factors = pandas.DataFrame(
 numpy.random.randn(T, K),
    columns=[f"Factor{i+1}" for i in range(K)]
)
test_assets = pandas.DataFrame(
 numpy.random.randn(T, N),
    columns=[f"Asset{i+1}" for i in range(N)]
)
riskfree = numpy.random.randn(T, 1)

res = FTFM.FamaMacBeth(test_assets, factors, riskfree, bandwidth = 1)
print(res.riskPremia())

#             Factor1  Factor2  Factor3  Factor4  Factor5  Factor6  Factor7  Factor8  Factor9 Factor10
#Risk Premia    0.042    0.224    0.149    0.068    0.114    0.051    0.038    0.071    0.116   -0.135
#Std Error    (0.258)  (0.189)  (0.316)  (0.284)  (0.259)  (0.204)  (0.197)  (0.281)  (0.322)  (0.228)
```

## Decorators

This module provides decorators and helper functions for performance monitoring.

### `Performance` Decorator

A decorator that measures execution time and peak memory usage of the wrapped function:

```python
import FinToolsAP.Decorators as FTDE

@FTDE.Performance
def my_function(...):
    # your code
    return result
```

When invoked, it prints:

- Function name
- Start time and end time
- Elapsed duration
- Peak memory usage (formatted via humanbytes)

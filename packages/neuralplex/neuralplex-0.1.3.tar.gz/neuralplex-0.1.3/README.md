An object oriented educational/experimental neural network implementation.

## Introduction

**Neural-pleX** is an intuitive object oriented neural network implementation. The Neural-pleX API consists of Network, Layer, and Neuron constructors. The networks can be easily [visualized](#visualizations-of-the-network-before-and-after-training) using a visualization library.

## Installation

```bash
pip install neuralplex
```

## Usage

This implementation demonstrates each component of the API. A 3 layer neural network is constructed that has a 4 neuron input Layer and a 1 neuron output layer. The hidden layer has 8 neurons.

### Implement a 3 layer neural network

#### Import the Network, Layer, and Neuron classes.

```python
from neuralplex import Network, Layer, Neuron
```

#### Set a step.

```python
STEP = 1e-4
```

#### Construct a neural network by specifying the Neurons for each Layer and adding the Layers to a Network. 

The resulting neural network will have 4 input neurons, 1 ouput neuron, and 8 neurons in the hidden layer.

```python
l1 = Layer(neurons=[Neuron(m=random()) for i in range(0, 4)], step=STEP)
l2 = Layer(neurons=[Neuron(m=random()) for i in range(0, 8)], step=STEP)
l3 = Layer(neurons=[Neuron(m=random())], step=STEP)
n1 = Network([l1, l2, l3])
```

#### With the Network defined, you can train the network. 

Here the network is trained to recognize the nibble 1111 as the decimal number 15.

```python
n1.train([1,1,1,1], [15])
```

You can generate and print a prediction using the `predict` method. Because the network underwent just one iteration of training, the estimate will likely be inaccurate. The accuracy of the prediction can be improved by iteratively training the network. Please see the [Train and Visualize a Neural-pleX Network](#train-and-visualize-a-neural-plex-network) implementation for an example of how to iteratively train the network.

```python
prediction = n1.predict([1,1,1,1])
print(prediction)
```

## Example

### Train and visualize a Neural-pleX network

In this example you will use [D3](https://d3js.org/) and [D3Blocks](https://d3blocks.github.io/d3blocks/pages/html/index.html) in order to visualize a neural network _before_ and _after_ training.

#### Import the necessary dependencies.

```python
from random import random, randint
import pandas as pd
from neuralplex import Network, Layer, Neuron, get_edge_data
from d3blocks import D3Blocks
```

#### Implement a function that will visualize the network.

```python
def visualize(n):

    d3 = D3Blocks()

    df = pd.DataFrame(get_edge_data(n))

    df['weight'] = df['weight'] * 42

    d3.d3graph(df, charge=1e4, filepath=None)

    for index, source, target, weight in df.to_records():
        if source.startswith('l1'):
            color = 'green'
        elif source.startswith('l2'):
            color = 'red'
        else:
            color='yellow'

        d3.D3graph.node_properties[source]['color'] = color
        d3.D3graph.node_properties[source]['size'] = weight

    d3.D3graph.show(save_button=True, filepath='./Neural-pleX.html')
```

#### Set a step.

```python
STEP = 1e-5
```

#### Construct a network.

```python
n = Network([Layer(neurons=[Neuron(m=random(), name=f'l{layer}-p{i}') for i in range(1, size+1)], step=STEP) for layer, size in zip([1,2,3], [4, 8, 1])])
```

#### Use D3 and D3Blocks in order to visualize the network _before_ training.

```python
visualize(n)
```

#### Train the network.

```python
for i in range(0, int(1e5)):
    rn = randint(1, 15)
    b = [int(n) for n in bin(rn)[2:]]
    while len(b) < 4:
        b = [0] + b
    n.train(b, [rn])
```

#### Use D3 and D3Blocks in order to visualize the network _after_ training.

```python
visualize(n)
```

##### Visualizations of the network before and after training:

The green nodes comprise the inputs, the red nodes comprise the hidden layer, and the yellow node is the output. The size of the Neuron is proportional to its coefficient and dependent on its random initialization and subsequent training.

## Test

### How to run the Nibble Challenge

A model is trained that estimates a decimal value given a binary nibble.

#### Clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/faranalytics/neuralplex.git
```

#### Change directory into the repository.

```bash
cd neuralplex
```

#### Install the package in editable mode.

```bash
pip install -e .
```

#### Run the tests.

```bash
python -m unittest -v
```

##### Output

HintEval enables users to generate and evaluate hints for their questions, helping detect better and more meaningful hints. With HintEval, you can:

1. Restructure your own datasets or question/answer pairs into a standardized format, making it easier to ensure reproducibility.
2. Generate synthetic hints for your questions using large language models.
3. Evaluate your hints using a variety of metrics that assess different aspects of hint quality from multiple angles.

:::{dropdown} What is a Hint?
Hints are clues that guide individuals toward a solution without explicitly providing the answer. They encourage critical thinking, reasoning, and memorization skills, as individuals engage in active problem-solving rather than passively receiving answers.

SUBJECT: LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA S5678: Updated Sky localization

The LIGO Scientific Collaboration, the Virgo Collaboration, and the KAGRA
Collaboration report:

We have conducted further analysis of the LIGO Hanford Observatory (H1) and
LIGO Livingston Observatory (L1) data around the time of the compact binary
merger (CBC) candidate S5678 (GCN Circular ***CITE ORIGINAL GCN ID, e.g.
25012***). Parameter estimation has been performed using Bilby [1] and a new
sky map, Bilby.multiorder.fits,0, distributed via GCN and SCiMMA notices, is
available for retrieval from the GraceDB event page:

https://gracedb.invalid/superevents/S5678

For the Bilby.multiorder.fits,0 sky map, the 90% credible region is well fit by
an ellipse with an area of 82 deg2 described by the following DS9 region (right
ascension, declination, semi-major axis, semi-minor axis, position angle of the
semi-minor axis):
   icrs; ellipse(03h08m, -45d08m, 8.82d, 2.98d, 111.99d)
Marginalized over the whole sky, the a posteriori luminosity distance estimate
is 522 +/- 102 Mpc (a posteriori mean +/- standard deviation).

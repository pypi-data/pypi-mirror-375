This module allows you to convert leads or opportunities into project
tasks. It supports the following features:

- Optional automatic archiving of the lead after conversion.

- Ability to configure a Force Project so tasks are created directly
  without a popup.

- Preserves attachments and messages from the lead.

**DISCLAIMER:** This module is a forward-port of a module from Odoo S.A.
and as such, it is not included in the OCA CLA. That means we do not
have a copy of the copyright on it like all other OCA modules.

Configuration
=============

1. Ensure that your user has at least the following access rights:

   - Project: Project User
   - CRM: Salesperson

These permissions are required to create tasks from leads.

Usage
=====

1. Open the CRM settings and configure:

   - Force Project: If set, all tasks created from leads will be
     assigned to this project without asking the user.
   - Archive Lead: If enabled, the lead will be archived after
     converting it to a task.

   |crm_settings|

2. Navigate to *CRM > Sales > My pipeline*

3. Open an existing lead or create a new one.

4. Depending on the Archive Lead setting:

   - Enabled → The button will be labeled "Convert to Task".

   |convert_to_task|

   - Disabled → The button will be labeled "Create Task".

   |create_task|

5. When clicking the button (either Create Task or Convert to Task), two
   scenarios are possible:

   - Force Project set → The task is created immediately and linked to
     the configured project.
   - No Force Project set → A popup appears allowing you to select a
     project. Click Create Task in the popup to proceed.

6. After creation, you will be redirected to the new task form view. All
   relevant lead information, including attachments and messages, will
   be copied to the task.

class ScreenRecorder:
    """A class to record screen activity of a programmatic browser
    instance and generate a video file.

    The ScreenRecorder class facilitates the recording of screen activity
    from a programmatic browser session and generates a video file of the
    recorded session.

    Hardware requirements:
        The ScreenRecorder requires 1 dedicated thread running in the
        background for screen capturing and a second non-dedicated thread
        for screenshot processing.

    Known limitations:
        - Does not handle screen size changes, only keeps frames of
            the most common size.
        - Does not manage scenarios where a new BrowserManager instance
            must be created (e.g., instance is deleted).

    Future improvements:
        - Prevent calling start_recording if automatically_start_recording
            is True

    Example:
        from RPA.Browser.Selenium import Selenium  # installed separately
        from thoughtful.screen_recorder import ScreenRecorder, BrowserManager

        class YoutubeScraper(ScreenRecorder):
            def __init__(self) -> None:

        ... Perform actions here ...

        Args:
            browser_manager (BrowserManager): Class providing a common
                interface for interacting with the browser.
            disable_screen_recorder (bool): Disables the ScreenRecorder when
                set to `True`. The intent of `disable_screen_recorder` is to
                make it easier for a user to enable/disable the ScreenRecorder
                for production runs.
            use_real_fps (bool): When recording, we are not able to reliably
                record a constant frame rate due to the time it takes for
                the BrowserManager to take a screenshot. This time is
                dependent on both the underlying hardware and the
                BrowserManager code itself. In order to maximize the number
                of screenshots we are able to take, we limit the logic
                controlling the taking of screenshots. As result, we have
                chosen not to add logic to granularly control the rate at
                which screenshots are taken and in turn have a dynamically
                determined fps that can only be calculated after all frames
                of the video have been taken.

                If `use_real_fps` is True, we will calculate
                self._real_fps after all video frames have been taken
                and adjust the video to utilize self._real_fps. Adjusting
                the video to utilize self._real_fps is a time intensive
                process (about 6 minutes of processing per 60 minutes
                recorded) - to speed up video recording, it is recommended
                to set `use_real_fps` to False.
                If `use_real_fps` is False, we will utilize self._baseline_fps
                which will result in the video being either shorter or longer
                than reality. If self._baseline_fps is lower than
                self._real_fps, the output video will be longer (slower)
                than reality. If self._baseline_fps is higher than
                self._real_fps, the output video will be shorter (faster)
                than reality.
            automatically_start_recording (bool): If True, the recording
                will automatically start as soon as a browser is detected in
                the BrowserManager instance
            video_height (int): Height of the output video. Defaults to 1080.
            video_width (int): Width of the output video. Defaults to 1920.
            output_folder_path (str): Path to folder to store output video file.
            output_video_name (Optional[str]): Name of the output video file.
            single_host_thread (bool): The program is being run with
                only one thread/vCPU. In this case, we cannot have a dedicated
                screen recording thread - we must instead periodically give
                access back to the scheduler to allow operations form other
                threads to occur.

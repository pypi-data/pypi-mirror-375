# LLRQ - Log-Linear Reaction Quotient Dynamics

A Python package for analyzing chemical reaction networks using the log-linear reaction quotient dynamics framework described in Diamond (2025) "Log-Linear Reaction Quotient Dynamics" ([arXiv:2508.18523](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.18523)).

## Overview

This framework introduces a novel approach to modeling chemical reaction networks where reaction quotients (Q) evolve exponentially toward equilibrium when viewed on a logarithmic scale. Unlike traditional mass action kinetics, this yields analytically tractable linear dynamics in log-space.

### Key Equation

For reaction networks, the dynamics follow:
```
d/dt ln Q = -K ln(Q/Keq) + u(t)
```

Where:
- **Q**: Vector of reaction quotients measuring distance from equilibrium
- **Keq**: Vector of equilibrium constants
- **K**: Relaxation rate matrix
- **u(t)**: External drive vector (e.g., ATP/ADP ratios)

## Framework Advantages

1. **Analytical Solutions**: Exact solutions exist for arbitrary network topologies
2. **Thermodynamic Integration**: Automatic incorporation of constraints via ΔG = RT ln(Q/Keq)
3. **Decoupled Dynamics**: Conservation laws separate from reaction quotient evolution
4. **Linear Control**: External energy sources couple linearly to dynamics
5. **Tractable Analysis**: Decades of linear systems theory become applicable

## Installation

### From PyPI (when available)
```bash
pip install llrq

    reactant_species="A",
    product_species="B",
    equilibrium_constant=2.0,
    relaxation_rate=1.0,
    initial_concentrations={"A": 1.0, "B": 0.1}
)

# Solve the dynamics

    initial_conditions={"A": 1.0, "B": 0.1},
    t_span=(0, 10),
    method='analytical'
)

```

### SBML Model Example

```python

# Load SBML model
network, dynamics, solver, visualizer = llrq.from_sbml(
    'model.xml',
    equilibrium_constants=np.array([2.0, 1.5, 0.8]),  # Keq for each reaction
    relaxation_matrix=np.diag([1.0, 0.5, 1.2])        # K matrix (diagonal)
)

# Solve with external drive
def atp_drive(t):
    return np.array([0.5, 0.0, -0.2])  # Drive for each reaction

dynamics.external_drive = atp_drive
solution = solver.solve(
    initial_conditions=network.get_initial_concentrations(),
    t_span=(0, 20)
)

## Mathematical Framework

### Single Reaction Dynamics
For a single reaction with external drive:
```
d/dt ln Q = -k ln(Q/Keq) + u(t)
```

**Analytical solution** (constant u):
```
Q(t) = Keq * exp[(ln(Q₀/Keq) - u/k) * exp(-kt) + u/k]
```

### Multiple Reactions
Vector form for reaction networks:
```
d/dt ln Q = -K ln(Q/Keq) + u(t)
```

**Matrix exponential solution** (constant u):
```
ln Q(t) = exp(-Kt) * [ln(Q₀/Keq) - K⁻¹u] + K⁻¹u + ln Keq
```

### Connection to Mass Action
For single reaction A ⇌ B with mass action rates kf, kr:
- Equilibrium constant: `Keq = kf/kr`
- Relaxation rate: `k = kr(1 + Keq)` (ensures agreement near equilibrium)

### Control Theory Integration
The linear dynamics enable direct application of control theory:

**LQR Control**: For quadratic cost J = ∫[x^T Q x + u^T R u]dt:
```
u*(t) = -R⁻¹B^T P x(t)
```
where P solves the Riccati equation: PA + A^T P - PBR⁻¹B^T P + Q = 0

**Frequency Response**: Transfer function H(s) = (K + sI)⁻¹B enables:
- Bode plot analysis for stability margins
- Optimal sinusoidal control design
- Frequency-domain entropy optimization

**Thermodynamic Constraints**: Entropy production rate:
```
dS/dt = x^T K x + x^T u
```
enables entropy-aware control design balancing performance and thermodynamic cost.

## Applications

### Traditional Applications
- **Metabolic Engineering**: Optimize pathway design using K as design variable
- **Drug Discovery**: Predict drug effects throughout metabolic networks
- **Systems Medicine**: Classify metabolic disorders via eigenvalue analysis

- **Sparse Control**: L1-regularized control for minimal intervention strategies
- **Constrained Optimization**: Control with resource limits and safety constraints
- **Frequency-Domain Design**: Sinusoidal control for periodic metabolic cycles

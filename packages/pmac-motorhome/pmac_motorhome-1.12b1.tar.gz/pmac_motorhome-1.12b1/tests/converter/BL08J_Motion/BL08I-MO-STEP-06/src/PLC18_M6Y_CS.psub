; BL08J-OP-HFM-06 Y jack coordinate system
; We have three jacks and so we use the standard 3 jack CS.
; Here is the layout of the jacks as seen from above,
; with coordinates in (X mm, Z mm) 
; from IDT drwaing DLS-208-11-0001-E - 5-9-17-Layout1

; From Jon Kelly (JIRA I08-268):
; - Vertical (positive Y) offset between the Jack spherical pivots and the optic is 408 mm.
; - The horizontal offset from the centre of the Cone Jack to the optic is outboard (positive X) 94 mm.
;
; Therefore according to the definition in the CS,
; the motors are assigned to the CS axes as follows:
; - J1: #4
; - J2: #6
; - J3: #5
;
; Here follows the comment from the top of the CS file.
;
;
;; Define motion of a generic 3 jack system. Jacks should be numbered in a 
;; clockwise order looking from the top with J1 having the smallest Z value
;;
;; Defined axes:
;; - X (addr 6) = Pitch in i15 EGUs
;; - Y (addr 7) = Roll in i15 EGUs
;; - Z (addr 8) = Height in same EGUs as jacks
;;
;; Macros (and example values):
;; - COORD   CS number (only works for CS 1..9), e.g. 2
;; - PLC   PLC number, should be CS number+15, e.g. 17
;; - J1    Axisnum for jack 1, e.g. 2
;; - J1X   global X co-ord of J1 base in mm, e.g. 0
;; - J1Z   global Z co-ord of J1 base in mm, e.g. -100
;; - J2    Axisnum for jack 2, e.g. 3
;; - J2X   global X co-ord of J2 base in mm, e.g. 50
;; - J2Z   global Z co-ord of J2 base in mm, e.g. 100
;; - J3    Axisnum for jack 3, e.g. 4
;; - J3X   global X co-ord of J3 base in mm, e.g. -50
;; - J3Z   global Z co-ord of J3 base in mm, e.g. 100
;; - MD    depth of surface in mm, e.g. 10
;; - MCX   global X co-ord of measure point in mm, e.g. 0
;; - MCZ   global Z co-ord of measure in mm, e.g. 10

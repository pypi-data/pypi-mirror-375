# Apify Loaders

```bash
pip install llama-index-readers-apify
```

## Apify Actor Loader

[Apify](https://apify.com/) is a cloud platform for web scraping and data extraction,
which provides an [ecosystem](https://apify.com/store) of more than a thousand
ready-made apps called _Actors_ for various scraping, crawling, and extraction use cases.

This loader runs a specific Actor and loads its results.

## Usage

In this example, we’ll use the [Website Content Crawler](https://apify.com/apify/website-content-crawler) Actor,
which can deeply crawl websites such as documentation, knowledge bases, help centers,
or blogs, and extract text content from the web pages.
The extracted text then can be fed to a vector index or language model like GPT
in order to answer questions from it.

To use this loader, you need to have a (free) Apify account
and set your [Apify API token](https://console.apify.com/account/integrations) in the code.

```python
from llama_index.core import Document
from llama_index.readers.apify import ApifyActor

reader = ApifyActor("<My Apify API token>")

documents = reader.load_data(
    actor_id="apify/website-content-crawler",
    run_input={
        "startUrls": [{"url": "https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/"}]
    },
    dataset_mapping_function=lambda item: Document(
        text=item.get("text"),
        metadata={
            "url": item.get("url"),
        },
    ),
)
```

This loader is designed to be used as a way to load data into
[LlamaIndex](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/tree/main/llama_index) and/or subsequently
used as a Tool in a [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) Agent.

## Apify Dataset Loader

[Apify](https://apify.com/) is a cloud platform for web scraping and data extraction,
which provides an [ecosystem](https://apify.com/store) of more than a thousand
ready-made apps called _Actors_ for various scraping, crawling, and extraction use cases.

This loader loads documents from an existing [Apify dataset](https://docs.apify.com/platform/storage/dataset).

## Usage

In this example, we’ll load a dataset generated by
the [Website Content Crawler](https://apify.com/apify/website-content-crawler) Actor,
which can deeply crawl websites such as documentation, knowledge bases, help centers,
or blogs, and extract text content from the web pages.
The extracted text then can be fed to a vector index or language model like GPT
in order to answer questions from it.

To use this loader, you need to have a (free) Apify account
and set your [Apify API token](https://console.apify.com/account/integrations) in the code.

```python
from llama_index.core import Document
from llama_index.readers.apify import ApifyDataset

reader = ApifyDataset("<Your Apify API token>")
documents = reader.load_data(
    dataset_id="<Apify Dataset ID>",
    dataset_mapping_function=lambda item: Document(
        text=item.get("text"),
        metadata={
            "url": item.get("url"),
        },
    ),
)
```

We welcome contributions to KiLM! This guide covers reporting issues, submitting code changes, and following our development standards.

## Reporting Issues

Before creating a new issue, search the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/barisgit/kilm/issues) for similar reports.

### Bug Reports

Include the following information:
- **KiLM version**: `kilm --version`
- **KiCad version**: Check Help â†’ About KiCad
- **Operating System**: Windows/macOS/Linux with version
- **Clear description**: What happened vs. what you expected
- **Reproduction steps**: Minimal steps to reproduce the issue
- **Error messages**: Full error output (use `--verbose` if available)
- **Configuration**: Relevant parts of your `config.yaml` if applicable

### Feature Requests

- **Use case**: Describe the problem you're trying to solve
- **Proposed solution**: How you envision the feature working
- **Alternatives**: Other approaches you've considered
- **Impact**: Who would benefit from this feature

## Pull Request Workflow

<Steps>

1. **Fork and Clone**
   
   Fork the [KiLM repository](https://github.com/barisgit/kilm) and clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/kilm.git
   cd kilm
   ```

2. **Development Setup**
   
   Follow the [Development Setup guide](/community/development/) to install dependencies.

3. **Create Feature Branch**
   
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-feature  # or fix/issue-123
   ```

4. **Implement Changes**
   
   Make your changes following the coding standards below.

5. **Quality Checks**
   
   Run the complete quality pipeline:
   ```bash
   # Type checking (required - zero "Any" types)
   pyrefly
   
   # Code formatting
   black .
   
   # Linting
   ruff check --fix .
   
   # Tests with coverage
   pytest --cov=kicad_lib_manager
   ```

6. **Commit Changes**
   
   Use descriptive commit messages:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: Add library template validation"
   # or
   git commit -m "fix: Handle missing KiCad config gracefully"
   ```

7. **Push and Create PR**
   
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/my-feature
   ```
   
   Open a Pull Request with:
   - Clear description of changes
   - Link to relevant issues ("Closes #123")
   - Screenshots/examples if applicable

</Steps>

## Coding Standards

### Type Safety (Mandatory)
- **Complete type hints**: All functions must have proper type annotations
- **Zero "Any" types**: Use specific types, protocols, or generics instead
- **Type checking**: Code must pass `pyrefly` type checking without errors

### Code Quality
- **Professional standards**: No emojis in code, comments, or output
- **No hardcoding**: Use constants, configuration, or environment variables
- **Cross-platform**: Use `pathlib.Path` for all file operations
- **Error handling**: Consistent error patterns with informative messages

### Testing Requirements
- **New features**: Must include corresponding tests
- **Bug fixes**: Add regression tests where applicable
- **Coverage**: Aim for high test coverage of new code
- **Integration tests**: Test KiCad integration where possible

### Documentation
- **Docstrings**: Use clear, concise docstrings for public functions
- **Comments**: Explain complex logic, not obvious operations
- **User-facing changes**: Update relevant documentation files

## Code Review Process

All Pull Requests undergo review for:
- **Functionality**: Does it work as intended?
- **Code quality**: Follows coding standards and best practices
- **Type safety**: Proper type annotations and no "Any" types
- **Testing**: Adequate test coverage
- **Documentation**: Clear and up-to-date

<Aside type="tip">
Running the quality checks locally before submitting saves time during review. Use the development tools outlined in the [Development Setup](/community/development/) guide.

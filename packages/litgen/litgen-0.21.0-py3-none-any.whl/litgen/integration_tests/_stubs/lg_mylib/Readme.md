The type of binding being used is set by the file binding.cfg:

```
├── src/litgen/integration_tests/_stubs/
│         └── lg_mylib/
│             ├── __init__.py
│             ├── __init__.pyi                # Stubs generated by litgen
│             ├── binding.cfg                 # A config file that will contains either "pybind" or "nanobind",
│             │                               #   and determines which bindings are being used
│             ├── use.py                      # Calling python -m lg_mylib.use "nanobind|pybind" will write to binding.cfg

### Update: 2025-07-11 12:30:34
## Analysis Results

The src/ directory is a remnant from the old architecture before the complete rewrite.

### Current State:
- **tinyagent/** (root level) - Active minimal implementation with 5 files
- **src/tinyagent/** - Empty directory structure from old architecture

### History:
- Commit 0da37f5 (July 1, 2025) performed complete rewrite
- Removed 26,710 lines of complex multi-module code
- Added 2,428 lines of minimal ReAct implementation
- Moved from src/tinyagent/ to root-level tinyagent/

### Recommendation:
Remove the empty src/ directory as it's no longer needed and may cause confusion.

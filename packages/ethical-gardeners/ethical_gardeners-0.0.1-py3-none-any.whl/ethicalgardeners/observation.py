"""
The Observation module defines how agents perceive the environment in the
Ethical Gardeners simulation.

This module implements different observation strategies to control what
information agents can access about the environment. It provides:

1. :py:class:`ObservationStrategy`: An abstract strategy interface for
implementing custom observation methods

2. Two concrete implementations:

   - :py:class:`TotalObservation`: Complete grid visibility
   - :py:class:`PartialObservation`: Limited visibility range

Observations are formatted as numpy arrays compatible with Gymnasium
environments.

Custom observation strategies can be implemented by extending the
ObservationStrategy class and implementing the required methods.

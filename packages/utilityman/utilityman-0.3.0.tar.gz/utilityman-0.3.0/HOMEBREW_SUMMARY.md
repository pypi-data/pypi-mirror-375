# Homebrew Setup Summary

## What's Been Created

✅ **Homebrew Formula** (`utilityman.rb`)
- Ready-to-use formula for Homebrew distribution
- Uses GitHub releases as source (better than PyPI for this case)
- Includes proper Python dependencies

✅ **Setup Script** (`scripts/homebrew-setup.sh`)
- Automatically gets SHA256 from GitHub releases
- Updates the formula with correct checksum
- Provides next-step guidance

✅ **Complete Documentation** (`HOMEBREW.md`)
- Two distribution strategies: Personal Tap vs Homebrew Core
- Step-by-step instructions for both approaches
- Testing, maintenance, and troubleshooting guides

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Create GitHub Release (Required First)
```bash
# Go to: https://github.com/stiles/utilityman/releases
# Create new release with tag: v0.3.0
```

### 2. Get SHA256 and Update Formula
```bash
cd /path/to/utilityman
./scripts/homebrew-setup.sh
```

### 3. Choose Distribution Strategy

**Option A: Personal Tap (Recommended Start)**
- Create `homebrew-utilityman` repository
- Users install with: `brew tap stiles/utilityman && brew install utilityman`
- Full control over updates and timing

**Option B: Homebrew Core Submission**
- Submit to official Homebrew repository
- Users install with: `brew install utilityman`
- Higher visibility, but requires approval process

## Why This Approach Works

1. **No PyPI Dependency**: Uses GitHub releases instead of PyPI
2. **Clean Python Packaging**: Homebrew handles Python environment automatically  
3. **Cross-Platform Ready**: Works on macOS (and Linux with Homebrew)
4. **Easy Updates**: Simple process for version bumps
5. **Professional Distribution**: Matches expectations of CLI tool users

## User Experience

Once set up, users get:
```bash
# Simple installation
brew tap stiles/utilityman    # (if using personal tap)
brew install utilityman

# Automatic updates
brew upgrade utilityman

# Clean uninstall
brew uninstall utilityman
```

## Files Overview

- `utilityman.rb` - The Homebrew formula
- `scripts/homebrew-setup.sh` - Automation helper
- `HOMEBREW.md` - Complete documentation
- `HOMEBREW_SUMMARY.md` - This summary

The setup is production-ready and follows Homebrew best practices.

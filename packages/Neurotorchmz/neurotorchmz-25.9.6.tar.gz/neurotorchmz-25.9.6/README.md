# Neurotorch

Neurotorch is a tool designed to extract regions of synaptic activity in neurons tagges with iGluSnFR, but is in general capable to find any kind of local brightness increase due to synaptic activity. It works with microscopic image series / videos and is able to open an variety of formats (for details see below)
- **Fiji/ImageJ**: Full connectivity provided. Open files in ImageJ and send them to Neurotorch and vice versa.
- **Stimulation extraction**: Find the frames where stimulation was applied
- **ROI finding**: Auto detect regions with high synaptic activity. Export data directly or send the ROIs back to ImageJ
- **Image analysis**: Analyze each frame of the image and get a visual impression where signal of synapse activity was detected
- **API**: You can access the core functions of Neurotorch also by importing it as an python module

Neurotorch can be downloaded in a standalone, portable version for Windows and MacOS. The download comes with a compatible Python environment containing all necessary dependencies. Please note that Fiji/ImageJ as well as TraceSelector are not included in the build. However Neurotorch is able to automatically install them once you want to use them.

### Installation for advanced users 

If you already have Python installed, you can also install it via pip as a very small (~ 1 MB) package:
```bash
pip install neurotorchmz
```
This approach is the recommended way if you are familiar with Python as it minimizes the overhead of downloading and storing Python multiple times. It is recommened to use a virtual environment manager like [miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/). Please refer to the [documentation](https://andreasmz.github.io/neurotorch/introduction/installation/) for more details.

If you want to use the Fiji/ImageJ bridge you will need to install OpenJDK and Apacha maven and add them to your system PATH. While Neurotorch is able to install those for you into your AppData folder, you can also install them manually from [openjdk.org](https://openjdk.org/) and [maven.apache.org](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)

To run Neurotorch, type
```bash
python -m neurotorchmz
```
You can create a shortcut on your Desktop where you replace the command python with the path to your python executable.

If you want to interact with Neurotorch you can import it as an module
```python
import neurotorchmz
session = neurotorchmz.start_background(headless=False)
```

To update your installation, type
```bash
pip install neurotorchmz --upgrade
```

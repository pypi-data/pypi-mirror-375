# Miscellaneous Development Space 🌱

This directory serves as an incubation space for new functionality that is still finding its place in the codebase. Think of it as a "development nursery" where new features and tools can grow before being moved to their permanent homes.

## 🎯 Purpose

- **Experimental Development**: A space to develop and test new features without immediately committing to their final location
- **Flexible Categorization**: Allow functionality to evolve naturally before determining its final category
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Quick implementation of ideas without overhead of immediate proper categorization

## 📋 Guidelines

### When to Use This Space

1. **New Features**
   - When you're not sure where a new feature belongs
   - When the purpose might change during development
   - When experimenting with different approaches

2. **Temporary Development**
   - For proof-of-concept implementations
   - For features that might span multiple categories
   - For utilities that need testing in different contexts

### When to Graduate Code

Code should move out of this directory when:
- Its purpose and category become clear
- It's being used by other packages
- It's stable and well-tested
- It has a clear, single responsibility

## 🔄 Current Status

This is an active development space that will naturally cycle between:
- Being empty (when all code has found its proper home)
- Containing experimental features
- Housing temporary implementations

### ✅ Best Practices

1. **Documentation**
   - Document experimental code
   - Note intended purpose
   - Track dependencies

2. **Clean Up**
   - Remove unused experiments
   - Graduate stable code
   - Keep directory organized

3. **Communication**
   - Note what you're working on
   - Update team on status
   - Document decisions

## 🚀 Using This Space

1. Create a subdirectory for your experiment
2. Add basic documentation
3. Implement and test
4. Either:
   - Graduate to proper location
   - Archive if unsuccessful
   - Continue development

## 📝 Notes

- This is not a permanent home for code
- Regular cleanup is encouraged
- Document decisions about code movement

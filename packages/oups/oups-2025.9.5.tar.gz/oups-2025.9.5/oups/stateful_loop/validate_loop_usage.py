"""
AST-based validation for ``StatefulLoop`` usage.

This module enforces the positive placement rules for ``StatefulLoop``:

- The ``for`` statement iterating over ``loop.iterate(...)`` must be
  immediately followed by a ``with <item_ctx> as ...:`` statement, where
  ``<item_ctx>`` is the loop target variable.
- Any ``loop.buffer(...)`` calls within that loop must appear as direct
  statements inside the body of that single ``with`` block (i.e., at the same
  indentation level as other top-level statements inside the ``with``), not
  inside conditionals, nested loops, nested ``with`` blocks, try/except, match
  blocks, comprehensions, or nested function/class bodies.

This check is intended to run before the loop begins and is strict: if the
source file cannot be read, the calling code should surface that failure.

    Validate placement rules for ``StatefulLoop.buffer`` at iterate callsite.

    The validation enforces the following constraints for the loop where
    ``for item_ctx in loop.iterate(...):`` appears:

    - The first statement in the loop body must be a single ``with`` statement
      using the iteration context variable, e.g., ``with item_ctx as item:``.
    - Any calls to ``loop.buffer(...)`` must be top-level statements inside
      that ``with`` block (i.e., not nested inside conditionals/loops/try/with
      blocks, functions/classes/lambdas, or comprehensions).
    - No ``loop.buffer(...)`` call can appear outside that first ``with`` block
      within the same loop.

    ----------
    loop : StatefulLoop
        The loop instance for which placement is being validated.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the structure of the loop body or the placement of ``buffer`` calls
        violates the rules above.

    Notes
    -----
    - This check analyzes the caller's source file using the AST and is intended
      to run before the first iteration as a fail-fast safeguard.
    - The function assumes Python 3.10+ AST (e.g., presence of ``ast.Match``).

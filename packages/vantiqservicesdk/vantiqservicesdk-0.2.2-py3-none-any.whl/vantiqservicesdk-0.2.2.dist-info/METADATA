## Repository Contents

This repository contains an SDK for building Vantiq Service Connectors in Python. Service connectors allow some of all
of a Vantiq service to be implemented outside the Vantiq platform.  The typical use case for this is to leverage a language other than VAIl (in this case Python).  One major use case for Python is to take advantage of its broad support for ML/Generative AI libraries.

## Overview of a Service Connector

TBD...   Python Service Connectors are only used internally by Vantiq at this point.

## Building a Service Connector

Running this code required Python 3.8 or later.

To use the SDK, install it into your Python environment.  Using `pip`, 

```commandline
pip install vantiqservicesdk
```

Other Python environment tools may use different commands.

Once it is installed, you can import it.

```python

from vantiqservicesdk import BaseVantiqServiceConnector
```

More details TBD...

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides French individual income tax calculations to AI assistants.

## Current Functionality

This MCP server currently supports:

- **Individual Income Tax Calculations**: Calculate French income tax (impôt sur le revenu) based on net taxable income and household composition (quotient familial)
- **Tax Brackets**: Retrieve current French income tax brackets from official government sources
- **Dynamic Data**: Uses web scraping from service-public.fr to get up-to-date tax information with fallback to hardcoded data

## Data Sources

The current version uses web scraping with MarkItDown to fetch tax information from official French government websites (primarily service-public.fr). In future versions, this may be replaced with official APIs or other more reliable data sources when available.

## Installation

```bash
# Install via pip
pip install french-tax-mcp

# Or install via uv (recommended)
uv pip install french-tax-mcp
```

## MCP Configuration

Add to your MCP configuration file (`~/.config/mcp/mcp.json` or workspace `.kiro/settings/mcp.json`):

```json

  "mcpServers": {
    "french-tax-mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",

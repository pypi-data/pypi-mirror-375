=================

RapidFuzz performs fuzzy string matching between two or more sequences using various string metrics.

Fundamental algorithms
----------------------
RapidFuzz provides a wide range of fundamental algorithms for string matching.
In addition it provides an API compatible implementation of all algorithms in ``thefuzz`` \/ ``fuzzywuzzy``.

Performant
----------
Rapidfuzz wraps highly-optimized implementations written in C++.
Enjoy the flexibility of Python with the speed of compiled code.

Easy to use
-----------
RapidFuzz's high level syntax makes it accessible and productive for programmers
from any background or experience level.

Compatible
----------
RapidFuzz provides a pure python fallback for every algorithm. This ensures that the library works on platforms
where compiling a C extension is not possible.

Open source
-----------
Distributed under a :ref:`MIT License <my-license-label>`, RapidFuzz is developed and maintained `publicly on GitHub <https://github.com/rapidfuzz/RapidFuzz>`_.

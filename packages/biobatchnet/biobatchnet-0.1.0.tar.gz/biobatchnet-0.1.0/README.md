# BioBatchNet

## Installation
### Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Manchester-HealthAI/BioBatchNet](https://github.com/Manchester-HealthAI/BioBatchNet
```

### Set Up the Environment

Create a virtual environment and install dependencies using `environment.yml`:

#### Using Conda:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate bbn
```

## BioBatchNet Usage

### Enter BioBatchNet
```bash
cd BioBatchNet
```

### Construct dataset
For the IMC dataset, place the dataset inside:

```bash
mv <your-imc-dataset> Data/IMC/
```

For scRNA-seq data, create a folder named `gene_data` inside the `Data` directory and place the dataset inside:

```bash
mkdir -p Data/gene_data/
mv <your-scrna-dataset> Data/scRNA-seq/
```

### Batch effect correction

**For IMC Data**
To process **IMC** data, run the following command to train BioBatchNet:
```bash
python imc.py -c config/IMC/IMMUcan.yaml
```

**For scRNA-seq Data**
To process **scRNA-seq** data, modify the dataset, run the following command to train BioBatchNet:
```bash
python scrna.py -c config/IMC/macaque.yaml
```

## CPC Usage

CPC utilizes the **embedding output from BioBatchNet** as input. The provided sample data consists of the **batch effect corrected embedding of IMMUcan IMC data**.

To use CPC, ensure you are running in the **same environment** as BioBatchNet.  
All experiment results can be found in the following directory:

```bash
cd CPC/IMC_experiment
```

âœ… **Key Notes**:  
- CPC requires embeddings from BioBatchNet as input.  
- Sample data includes batch-corrected IMMUcan IMC embeddings.  
- Ensure the **same computational environment** as BioBatchNet before running CPC.

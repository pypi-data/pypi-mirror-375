- ✅ **Webhook Integration**: Full webhook lifecycle management
- ✅ **Tool Count Achieved**: 56 tools (growth from 31 to 58 as planned)

## Test Coverage
- ⚠️ **Unit Tests**: Basic pytest structure exists, but coverage incomplete for new modules
- ⚠️ **Integration Tests**: Discord client mocking required for new categories
- ❌ **E2E Tests**: Real Discord server testing not implemented for Phase 2 additions

## Documentation
- ✅ **AGENTS.md**: Comprehensive agent guidelines and development standards

- ❌ **Integration Guides**: External system integration documentation missing

## Deployment Status
- ✅ **STDIO Transport**: Ready for MCP client integration
- ⚠️ **HTTP Transport**: Basic support exists, needs extensive testing
- ⚠️ **SSE Transport**: Framework support exists, implementation incomplete

## Next Development Priorities
Following Phase 2 completion, Phase 3 will focus on gateway integration and real-time features:

1. **Phase 3 Focus**: Gateway Integration (Week 9-10)
   - Complete event buffering system
   - Implement event filtering logic
   - Add ergonomic gateway manager integration
   - Enable real-time event processing

2. **HIGH**: Forum tools (thread management, posts)
3. **MEDIUM**: Audit and compliance tools
4. **LOW**: Emoji/sticker management tools

## Success Metrics

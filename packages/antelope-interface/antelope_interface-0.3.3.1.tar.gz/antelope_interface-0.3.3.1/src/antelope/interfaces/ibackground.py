"""
The Background interface is a hybrid interface that can be produced from the combination of  a complete index and
exchange interface for a self-contained database (terminate() and inventory() are required, and the resulting matrix
must be invertible)

The default implementation is a dumb proxy, for use when archives provide LCI information over an inventory interface.
 Here the proxy just 'masquerades' the contents to answer background instead of inventory queries.  Though it does not
 thrown an error, it is a conceptual violation for one data source to supply both inventory and background interfaces
 using the proxy implementation.

The LcBackground class, added with the antelope_lcbackground plugin, provides an engine that partially orders the
datasets in an ecoinvent-style unit process database and stores the results in a static set of scipy sparse arrays, in
a manner consistent with the JIE disclosure paper (augmented with the full LCIDB).

The (as yet hypothetical) antelope_brightway2 plugin can provide index, inventory, and background data for a bw2
database.

More plugins are yet imagined.

2. Scheduled PCI for left circumflex artery by Dr. Wilson on April 13, 2025

Medications:
1. Aspirin 325mg daily

HOSPITAL COURSE
Patient was admitted through the Emergency Department and taken emergently to the cardiac catheterization lab where he underwent successful PCI with stent placement to the right coronary artery. Post-procedure, the patient was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit (CCU) for close monitoring. Patient experienced a brief episode of ventricular fibrillation on the first night, which was successfully treated with defibrillation. Cardiology and endocrinology were consulted for management of heart failure and diabetes. Follow-up echocardiogram on April 12 showed improvement in EF to 45%. Patient underwent scheduled PCI of the left circumflex artery on April 13 without complications.

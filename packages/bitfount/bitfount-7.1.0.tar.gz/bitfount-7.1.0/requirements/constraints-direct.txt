# This file contains version constraints for our direct dependencies that are needed
# across files, rather than just in a single file.
#
# This file should be reviewed and updated regularly and our code fixed appropriately so
# that we can keep up with the latest versions of our dependencies.

# TODO: [BIT-5708] Unpin this once we support prefect database migrations.
prefect==3.4.5 # This matches the version in the bitfount app.

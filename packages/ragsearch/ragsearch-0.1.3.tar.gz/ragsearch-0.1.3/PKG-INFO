# ragsearch

`ragsearch` is a Python library designed for building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application that enables natural language querying over structured data. This tool leverages embedding models and a vector database (FAISS or ChromaDB) to provide an efficient and scalable search engine.

## Features
- Seamless integration with the Cohere AI LLM for generating embeddings.
- Utilizes FAISS for fast, in-memory vector storage and similarity search.
- Optional ChromaDB backend for persistent, scalable vector search using SQLite.
- Easy setup and configuration for different use cases.
- Simple web interface for user interaction.

## Installation
To install `ragsearch`, run the following command:

```bash
pip install ragsearch
```

Alternatively, for local development, use:

```bash
pip install /path/to/ragsearch
```

Ensure that you have all necessary dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install pandas faiss-cpu flask cohere chromadb
```

## Basic Setup
### Step 1: Prepare Your Data
Ensure you have your structured data in a CSV, JSON, or Parquet format. The data should include columns for the main content and any relevant metadata.

**Example data (`sample_data.csv`)**:
```csv
name,id,minutes,contributor_id,submitted,tags,n_steps,steps,description,ingredients,n_ingredients,average_rating,votes,Score,calories,total fat (PDV),sugar (PDV),sodium (PDV),protein (PDV),saturated fat (PDV),carbohydrates (PDV),category,meal_type,cuisine,difficulty

```


### Step 2: Initialize `ragsearch`
Use the `setup()` function to set up the `ragsearch` with your data and configuration.

**Example code (FAISS, default)**:
```python
from pathlib import Path
from ragsearch import setup

# Define your data path and configuration parameters
data_path = Path("path/to/your/sample_data.csv")
llm_api_key = "your-cohere-api-key"

# Initialize the RagSearchEngine (FAISS backend)
rag_engine = setup(data_path, llm_api_key)
```

**Example code (ChromaDB backend)**:
```python
from pathlib import Path
from ragsearch import setup

data_path = Path("path/to/your/sample_data.csv")
llm_api_key = "your-cohere-api-key"
chromadb_sqlite_path = "/path/to/chroma.sqlite3"
chromadb_collection_name = "your_collection_name"

# Initialize the RagSearchEngine (ChromaDB backend)
rag_engine = setup(
    data_path,
    llm_api_key,
    use_chromadb=True,
    chromadb_sqlite_path=chromadb_sqlite_path,
    chromadb_collection_name=chromadb_collection_name
)
```

### Step 3: Run a Search Query
Once the `ragsearch` is initialized, you can perform natural language searches.

**Example code**:
```python
query = "Find recipes with chicken"
results = rag_engine.search(query, top_k=5)

for result in results:
    print("Result:", result['metadata'])
```

## Running the Web Interface
### Step 1: Start the Flask Server
Run the following command to start the Flask server:
```bash
rag_engine.run()
```

### Step 2: Access the Web Interface
Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:8080/
```

### Step 3: Interact with the Web Interface
- Enter a search query in the input field.
- Click the **Submit** button.
- View the results displayed on the page.

## Testing the Package
### Running Unit Tests
Ensure your package functions as expected by running `pytest`:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

## Advanced Usage and Customization

### Using ChromaDB Backend
To use ChromaDB, set `use_chromadb=True` and provide the path to your ChromaDB SQLite file and collection name. This enables persistent, scalable vector search.

### Changing the Embedding Model
Modify the `llm_model_name` parameter in `setup()` to use different models, e.g., "large" or "small".

### Adding More Metadata
Include additional columns in your data for more detailed results.

### Customizing the Web Interface
Edit `index.html` in the `templates` directory to adjust the UI layout or add more user features.

## Troubleshooting
- **`AssertionError: d == self.d`**: Ensure the embedding dimension (`embedding_dim`) matches the output dimension from your embedding model.
- **`TypeError: embed() takes 1 positional argument`**: Use the correct keyword argument format for `embed()` based on your `cohere` version.

## Deployment Tips
- **Deploying to a Server**: Use services like Heroku, AWS, or Docker.

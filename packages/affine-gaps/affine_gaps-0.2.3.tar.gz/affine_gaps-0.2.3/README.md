__Affine Gaps__ is a __less-wrong__ single-file Numba-accelerated Python implementation of Osamu Gotoh affine gap penalty extensions 1982 [paper](https://doc.aporc.org/attach/Course001Papers/gotoh1982.pdf) for the Needleman-Wunsch and Smith-Waterman algorithms often used for global and local sequence alignment in Bioinformatics.
Thanks to the Numba JIT compiler, it's also competitive in terms of performance.

## Less Wrong

As reported in the "Are all global alignment algorithms and implementations correct?" [paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/031500v1.full.pdf) by Tomas Flouri, Kassian Kobert, Torbjørn Rognes, and Alexandros Stamatakis:

> In 1982 Gotoh presented an improved algorithm with lower time complexity. 
> Gotoh’s algorithm is frequently cited...
> While implementing the algorithm, we discovered two mathematical mistakes in Gotoh’s paper that induce sub-optimal sequence alignments.
> First, there are minor indexing mistakes in the dynamic programming algorithm which become apparent immediately when implementing the procedure.
> Hence, we report on these for the sake of completeness.
> Second, there is a more profound problem with the dynamic programming matrix initialization.
> This initialization issue can easily be missed and find its way into actual implementations.
> This error is also present in standard text books.
> Namely, the widely used books by Gusfield and Waterman.
> To obtain an initial estimate of the extent to which this error has been propagated, we scrutinized freely available undergraduate lecture slides.
> We found that 8 out of 31 lecture slides contained the mistake, while 16 out of 31 simply omit parts of the initialization, thus giving an incomplete description of the algorithm.
> Finally, by inspecting ten source codes and running respective tests, we found that five implementations were incorrect.

During my exploration of exiting implementations, I've noticed several bugs:

- several libraries initialize the header row/columns of penalty matrices with ±∞, causing overflows on the first iteration.
- initialize matrices to zeros, ignoring the first gap opening cost.
- combining opening and expansion costs where only the opening cost should be applied.
- even the most correct `needle` from EMBOSS uses `float` representation, which would obviously be numerically unstable on very long sequences.

## Installation

Numba is optional.
Installing without it gives a pure-Python baseline; installing with the `numba` extra enables JIT acceleration when a compatible Numba is available.

```sh
uv pip install affine-gaps          # minimal
uv pip install 'affine-gaps[numba]' # with JIT
```

Even without installing Python or touching PyPi, you can just use `uv` to get the latest version of the library:

```bash
$ uv tool install git+https://github.com/ashvardanian/affine-gaps.git
$ affine-gaps --help
```

## Using the Library

To obtain the alignment of two sequences, use the `needleman_wunsch_gotoh_alignment` function.

```python
from affine_gaps import needleman_wunsch_gotoh_alignment

insulin = "GIVEQCCTSICSLYQLENYCN"
glucagon = "HSQGTFTSDYSKYLDSRAEQDFV"
aligned_insulin, aligned_glucagon, aligned_score = needleman_wunsch_gotoh_alignment(insulin, glucagon)

print("Alignment 1:", aligned_insulin)  # GI-V---EQCC-TSICSLY---QL-ENYCN-
print("Alignment 2:", aligned_glucagon) # --D-FVHSQGTFTSDYSKYLDSRAEQDF--V
print("Score:", aligned_score)          # 41
```

If you only need the alignment score, you can use the `needleman_wunsch_gotoh_score` function, which uses less memory and works faster.

```python
from affine_gaps import needleman_wunsch_gotoh_score

score = needleman_wunsch_gotoh_score(insulin, glucagon)

print("Score:", score)
```

By default, a BLOSUM62 substitution matrix is used.
You can specify a different substitution matrix by passing it as an argument.

```python
from numpy import np

alphabet = "ARNDCQEGHILKMFPSTWYVBZX"
substitutions = np.zeros((len(alphabet), len(alphabet)), dtype=np.int8)
substitutions.fill(-1)
np.fill_diagonal(substitutions, 1)

aligned_insulin, aligned_glucagon, aligned_score = needleman_wunsch_gotoh_alignment(
    insulin, glucagon,
    substitution_alphabet=alphabet,
    substitution_matrix=substitutions,
    gap_opening=-2,
    gap_extension=-1,
)
```

That is similar to the following usage example of BioPython:

```python
from Bio import Align
from Bio.Align import substitution_matrices

aligner = Align.PairwiseAligner(mode="global")
aligner.substitution_matrix = substitution_matrices.load("BLOSUM62")
aligner.open_gap_score = open_gap_score
aligner.extend_gap_score = extend_gap_score
```

## Using the Command Line Interface

To compute the optimal global alignment of insulin and glucagon sequences with (5x-scaled) BLOSUM62 substitution matrix through CLI:

```bash
$ affine-gaps GIVEQCCTSICSLYQLENYCN HSQGTFTSDYSKYLDSRAEQDFV
>
> Sequence 1: GIVEQCCTSICSLYQLENYCN
> Sequence 2: HSQGTFTSDYSKYLDSRAEQDFV
>
> Alignment 1: GIVEQCCTSICSLY---QL-ENYCN-
> Alignment 2: GTF----TSDYSKYLDSRAEQDF--V
> Score:       22
```

To compute the local alignment of insulin and glucagon sequences through CLI:

```bash

$ affine-gaps GIVEQCCTSICSLYQLENYCN HSQGTFTSDYSKYLDSRAEQDFV --local
> 
> Sequence 1: GIVEQCCTSICSLYQLENYCN
> Sequence 2: HSQGTFTSDYSKYLDSRAEQDFV
> 
> Alignment 1: TSICSLYQLEN
> Alignment 2: TSDYSKY-LDS
> Score:       80
```

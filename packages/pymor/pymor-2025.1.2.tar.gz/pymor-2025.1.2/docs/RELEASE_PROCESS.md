# Release process and schedule

The release manager is responsible for ensuring that the following steps are performed:

- [ ] Fix the following dates
      (at least 10 weeks before the release, i.e.,
      5 weeks before the soft freeze):
      soft freeze &rarr;
      (4 weeks) &rarr;
      hard freeze &rarr;
      (1 week) &rarr;
      release day
- [ ] As soon as they are fixed,
      communicate dates for soft freeze, hard freeze, and release day
      (via GitHub discussions).
- [ ] In the next community meeting after fixing the release day:
  - [ ] Go through pull requests and issues without a milestone and
        assign them to the upcoming release if necessary.
- [ ] At the day of the soft freeze:
  - [ ] Communicate soft freeze (via GitHub discussions).
        At this point,
        no new feature pull requests can be added to the release milestone.
        Exceptions need to be approved by the release manager.
  - [ ] Make all developers aware that they should finish their pull requests
        (ping in the PRs).
  - [ ] Assign main developers to pull requests that still require review.
        Make sure that reviews are finished early,
        such that enough time remains to incorporate requested changes.
  - [ ] Start working on the release notes., e.g., using GitHub CLI:

    ```bash
    gh pr list --search "milestone:202x.y.z" --state all --json number,title,url \
    --template '{{range .}}{{tablerow (printf "#%v" .number) .title .url}}{{end}}'
    ```

    Make sure that all features merged later are mentioned in the release notes as well.
    All new deprecations need to be mentioned in the release notes.

- [ ] One week before the hard freeze:
  - [ ] Remind everyone of the upcoming hard freeze and missing reviews or unfinished pull requests
        (ping in the PRs).
  - [ ] Evaluate if there are pull requests that will not be merged before the hard freeze and
        decide if the hard freeze has to be postponed
        (which implies moving the release day as well).
  - [ ] If the hard freeze has to be moved,
        it is moved by exactly one week.
        This has to be communicated.
- [ ] At the day of the hard freeze:
  - [ ] Follow the steps outlined in [`RELEASE_CHECKLIST`](RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md).
  - [ ] Communicate hard freeze (via GitHub discussions).
        At this point, no new pull requests (except for potential bug fixes) can enter the release.
        Merging into `main` branch is not allowed until the release has happened
        (new feature PRs have to wait until after the release to get merged).
  - [ ] Determine number of commits and so on for the release notes and add these information.
        Merge the release notes branch into `main` when they are finished.
  - [ ] Update `AUTHORS.md` to include attributions for relevant contributions made to the
        release by non-main devs.
- [ ] At the day of the release:
  - [ ] Follow the steps outlined in [`RELEASE_CHECKLIST`](RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md).
- [ ] In the first community meeting after the release:
  - [ ] Select a new release manager for the next release and set the release day.
        However, the current release manager is still responsible for all point releases until the next release.
  - [ ] Assign a couple of issues (about 2 or 3) to each main developer and give them the milestone of the next release.

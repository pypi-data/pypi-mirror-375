# Zyntex - High-level Zig parser for Python
**Docs:** https://zyntex.readthedocs.io/en/latest

Zyntex is a Python library that allows you to parse and generate Zig code at a high level.
Function bodies and other low-level constructs are currently returned as raw strings.
Support for deeper elements is planned. Internally, it uses bindings to Zig's std AST parser,
making it both fast and memory-efficient.
Important: currently bindings are only available for `windows-x86_64`, `macos-x86_64`, and `linux-x86_64`.
On other architectures the library will not work. Support for additional targets is planned,
but low priority.

**Be aware that the project is at a very early stage of development
and is actively being developed.**

## Features

- Parse Zig source from strings or files.
- Code generation - emitting Zig code from Python objects via premade printers.
- High-performance, low-memory parsing powered by Zigâ€™s `std` parser.
- Easy-to-use, Pythonic API designed for inspection Zig code.

## Installation

```bash
pip install zyntex
```

## Minimal example
```python
from typing import cast

from zyntex.code_generation.premade import DefaultCodePrinter
from zyntex.syntax import VariableDeclaration
from zyntex import SourceCode

code_printer = DefaultCodePrinter()
src = SourceCode("const result: usize = 15 + 15;")

variable = cast(VariableDeclaration, src.content[0])
variable.is_public = True
print(code_printer.print(src)) # pub const result: usize = 15 + 15;
```

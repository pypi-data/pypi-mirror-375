# Features

- **👥 Profile Management:** Create multiple, independent profiles (e.g., for personal and work use) protected by a master password. Your data stays completely separate and secure.
- **📊 Status and session check:** See which profile is currently active, how much time you've got left in session, log count and the current profile's security level.
- **🛡️ Security First:** No passwords stored, not even hashed. Your masterkey is used to securely encrypt and decrypt a unique encryption key for each profile, ensuring only you can access your data.
- **🎲 Secure Password Generator:** Create strong passwords, customizable in length and symbol usage.
- **🗄️ Robust Log Management:** Safely add, find, and manage your sensitive data. Every operation is atomic, writing to a portable JSON file to prevent data corruption.
- **🔍 Intelligent Search:** Search by exact fields and a powerful **fuzzy search** to find what you need even if you make a typo.
- **🏷️ Tag-based Organization:** Add tags to your logs to filter and organize them your way.
- **✨ Modern Interface:** Built with Typer and Rich for a clean and pleasant user experience.
- **🌐 Cross-Platform:** Works on Linux, Windows, and MacOS, storing data in standard user directories for each OS.

## Installation

You need **Python 3.9+** and `pip` installed on your system.

### Option A: Install from PyPI (Recommended)

The easiest way to install `keybin` is directly from the Python Package Index (PyPI).

For command-line tools like this, it is highly recommended to use `pipx` to install them in an isolated environment. This avoids dependency conflicts with other Python projects.

1.  **Install pipx** (if you don't have it already):

    ```bash
    python3 -m pip install --user pipx
    python3 -m pipx ensurepath
    ```

    _(You may need to restart your terminal after this step)_

2.  **Install keybin using pipx:**

    ```bash
    pipx install keybin-cli
    ```

    If you prefer to use `pip`, you can install it directly:

    ```bash
    pip install keybin-cli
    ```

3.  **Verify the installation:**
    After installation, you can verify that keybin is working correctly.
    ```bash
    keybin --version
    ```

### Option B: Install from Source (For Developers)

If you want to contribute to the project or use the latest development version, you can install it from the source code.

1.  **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jotaesee/keybin.git

    cd keybin

    ```

2.  **(Recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install in editable mode:**
    This will install the package, but any changes you make to the source code will be immediately effective.
    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```

# Getting Started

Getting started with `keybin` is fast and intuitive. Here's a typical workflow for a first-time user to set up their secure vault.

### 1. Create Your First Profile

First, you'll need to create a profile. Think of a profile as your personal encrypted vault. You'll protect it with a strong master password. You only set a profile once, but you can have multiple profiles.
You could also use the default one, but remember, profiles with no masterkey are not encrypted!

```bash
# We'll use "profile add" to create a profile named "myprofile" with a master password
keybin profile add --user myprofile --key "your-very-strong-master-password"

```

**_Security Tip: You can create profiles without a masterkey, but a profile not secured does not encrypt it's logs._**

### 2. Log In to Your Profile

To start using a profile, you need to log into it. If the profile's secured, you'll need to provide your masterkey to login.

```bash
# If the selected profile is encrypted, keybin will prompt for your masterkey.
keybin login myprofile

```

**_Tip: You can check your current session status at any time with keybin status._**

### 3. Add Your First Password Log

Once you're logged in, you can add your first entry. For the most user-friendly experience, simply run the add command, and keybin will guide you.

```bash
# This will prompt you for all the necessary info (service, user, password, etc.).
keybin log add
```

You could also just use flags for a faster experience:

```bash
# --autopass will auto generate a new secure password.
keybin log add -s "GitHub" -u "jotaesee" --autopass -t dev -t personal
```

Pro Tip: Leave fields empty using --no-prompts or -n, this flag will skip missing info, and log it as you say.

### 4. Check your logs

Now, let's verify that your log was saved correctly. Use the find command to search your vault.

```bash
# A fuzzy search for "git" will find the "GitHub" log we just created.
keybin log find git
```

You could pair this fuzzy search with filters like email, service, tags and username, or direcly search a log by it's id.
You can also see all logs in the current profile by running keybin log find all.

### 5. Log Out of Your Profile

When you're finished, it's good practice to log out. This locks your vault, ensuring your data is secure until you log in again.

```bash
# The logout command ends the session, so secured commands are not accesible.
keybin logout
```

Pro-Tip: If you are already logged into a profile and want to change to another one without logging out first, you can use the "keybin profile switch <other_profile>" command.

# Detailed Usage

This section provides a detailed breakdown of all available commands and their options.

Most data-related commands (like adding or finding logs) require an active, logged-in session. You can check your current session with `keybin status`.

---

## Main Commands

These are the top-level commands available directly under `keybin`.

### `login`

```bash
keybin login <USER> [KEY]
```

**Arguments:**

    USER: The name of the profile you want to log into.

    KEY (Optional): The masterkey for the profile. If the profile is encrypted and the key is not provided, you will be prompted to enter it securely.

**Example:**

```bash
# Log into the 'personal' profile. It will prompt for the password.
keybin login personal
```

### `logout`

Logs out of the current profile, ending the secure session and locking the vault.

**Usage:**

```bash
keybin logout
```

### `status`

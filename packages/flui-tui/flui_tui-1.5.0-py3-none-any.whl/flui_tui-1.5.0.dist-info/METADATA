# Flui 🦆🦠🧬

Flui is a command-line tool for **rapidly sub-typing avian influenza** viruses without doing full assemblies.

* Flui **identifies the HA and NA segments** of a virus from [Nanopore][nanopore] [FASTQ][fastq] files using k-mer-based methods.
* Flui works with existing FASTQ files, but it can also monitor a folder for incoming FASTQ files, **providing real-time updates for an ongoing sequence run**.
* Flui runs in a terminal on any common platform, from a **Windows laptop to an SSH shell** on an HPC cluster.
* Flui has an **interactive user-interface** (TUI), showing continuous progress of the analysis.
* Flui uses a **simple, but robust metric**, to assign the subtype of the virus.

## Installation

> :warning: If you want to *develop*, rather than simply run `flui`, then see the section below for additional installation instructions.

### Recommended -- Install via UV

`flui` is a Python package.
[UV][uv] is a modern tool that simplifies the installation of Python packages, and is the recommended way to install `flui`.

To install `uv`, please follow the instructions from the [UV website][uv-install].

Once you have `uv` installed, you can install `flui` with a single command:

```sh
uv tool install flui-tui
```
You should now be able to run `flui --help`

### Alternative installation methods

You can install `flui` using any other traditional Python methods (such as `pip`).
If you don't want to install directly from the internet, you can also install `flui` from a zip file.
These zip files are available from the [releases page](https://github.com/dragonfly-science/flui/releases).

## Usage

To get help on how to launch the UI, type `flui --help` into the terminal and press enter.
This command will show the options available to you.
The two key things to provide are:

* `--run`: The path to a parent directory of the FastQ files.
  This directory should contain one or more runs, each containing multiple barcode sub-folders.
* `--ref`: This directory contains the reference genomes of HA and NA segments from different subtypes.

Typically, you will want to run a command like this:

```sh
flui --ref ref.fasta --run /path/to/fastq/files
```

## Test-driving for the impatient

Flui requires FastQ files from a Nanopore sequencing run, and a reference FASTA file.
If you don't have access to both of these files, then you can try Flui out this way:

* Download the sample reference file [here][sample_ref] (created using the [NCBI virus data][ncbi]).
* Download sample FastQ files for avian influenza from [this paper][sample_fastq].
  See the ``attached files'' section, and choose one or more of the zip files.
  Unzip the FastQ files into folders.

Once you have downloaded these files, unzip the FastQ downloads into a folder and then run the command:

```sh
flui --ref reference-ncbi.fasta --run /folder/with/fastq
```

After a few moments, you will see the application start up and begin processing any existing FastQ files.

## Navigating the application

Once you have started the application, you can navigate using the arrow keys and tab keys.
Detailed help is available inside the `flui` application.
Simply press the “h” button after starting the application.
You can also read detailed help information here: [help](src/flui/help.md).

## Saving results

Flui saves the results of the analysis to both a CSV and a JSON file when it exits.
It saves the current state of the analysis, including the scores and the reads.
(Note that this information is saved *even if the analysis is incomplete*.)
The files are saved in the current folder with date and time suffixes to prevent overwriting any existing files.

> :point_right: To avoid saving these files, start Flui with the `--no-dump` option.

## Configuration

The Flui app has several settings that can be changed, either at startup, or in a settings file.
The settings file must be called `flui.toml` and stored in the working directory.
In the settings file, you can set the k-mer sizes, the number of background processes for the analysis, and some UI colour options.
See the GitHub repository for an [example file][config].
Some settings can also be set on the command line (use `flui --help` to see these settings).
The settings are shown in the UI on the bottom right.

## How does it work?

Here is a brief overview of how Flui produces the scores for automatic sub-typing.

1. The `--ref` argument given on the command line points to a [FASTA][fasta] file.
   This FASTA file contains the multiple reference sequences for each of the different subtypes (e.g., H1N1, H5N2).
   These sequences have both the subtype and segment number or type in the sequence header (i.e., HA/H1N1).
   Only the HA and NA segments are used for sub-typing (others are not included).
2. When Flui starts, it reads the FASTA file and, for each segment/subtype  combination, it generates a k-mer distribution. 
   These distributions are stored in memory.
3. Flui then reads in any existing FastQ files in the folder and, for each read, it produces a k-mer distribution.
   These k-mer distributions are per run/barcode (this information is from the file name).
   As more reads are completed, the distribution for that run/barcode is updated.
4. Each barcode distribution is compared to the set of reference distributions, including a measure of the *Jensen-Shannon Distance* (JSD) to each reference’s distribution.
   (The JSD is the square root of the [Jensen-Shannon Divergence][shannon], and is a statistical [distance measure][metric]).
   A small JSD value (i.e., close to zero) indicates close resemblance of the k-mer distributions.  
5. The JSD is transformed to make it easier to interpret.
   First, it is normalised by dividing the average JSD between all reference distributions.
   This value is called JSDN.
   Close matches have JSDN values below 1.0 (i.e., the distances between the distributions are smaller than the distances between the references).
   To make this number easier to interpret, the complement of this value is multiplied by 100: Matching Score = (1 - JSDN) × 100.
6. The scores given in the UI are thus a *percentage reduction from the expected k-mer distribution distance*.
   Empirical tests indicate that values of around 6.0 and higher are typical for a close match.

## Development

For development, you will need to install the following dependencies:

* [uv][uv]
* [just][just]

Once `uv` is installed, you can use it to install some additional tools:

```sh
uv tool install ruff
uv tool install pyright
```

The `just` tool is used to run development-related tasks.
The `check` command runs all linting and tests, for example:

```sh
just check
```

At this stage, generating releases is not automated.

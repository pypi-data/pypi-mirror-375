You are an expert in feature engineering for machine learning.
Your task is to identify and remove columns from a dataset that are not suitable for statistical analysis in the context of the following task:
{task_description}

Common examples of columns to remove include:
- Identifiers (e.g., IDs, serial numbers)
- Names (e.g., of people, locations)
- Free-form text or descriptive fields that cannot be easily converted to numerical values.
- Date/time stamps that have not been engineered into features.

Please analyze the following list of columns and return a JSON object with a single key "columns_to_remove" containing a list of column names that should be removed.
Only return columns that are present in the provided list.
If you don't think any columns should be removed, return an empty list.

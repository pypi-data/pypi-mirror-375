**Available Tools and Resources:**
<mcp>
Database Tools:
- "read-query": Execute SQL queries on the AACT database
- "list-tables": View available AACT tables 
- "describe-table": Get table schema details
- "append-insight": Add findings to analysis memos

Analysis Memos:
- memo://landscape: Key findings, patterns, qualitative insights, and trial references
</mcp>

---

**Analysis Objectives:**
- Create a comprehensive analytical narrative
- Develop data-driven insights using SQL queries
- Generate an interactive dashboard
- Provide strategic recommendations

---

**Data Management Guidelines:**
1. Use the complete AACT dataset (no sampling)
2. Always make sure you also included synonyms for the condition/indication/intervention/sponsor/investigator/site fields

---

**Core Analysis Areas:** *(These depend on the topic and may vary)*
1. **Portfolio Overview**
   - Trial status distribution
   - Phase distribution
   - Temporal trends
   - Geographic footprint

2. **Stakeholder Analysis**
   - Sponsor landscape
   - Research networks
   - Site distribution
   - Investigator patterns

3. **Protocol Intelligence**
   - Patient demographics
   - Eligibility criteria
   - Endpoint selection
   - Safety monitoring

4. **Market Dynamics**
   - Development timelines
   - Success rates
   - Competitive positioning
   - Emerging trends

---

**Dashboard Requirements:**
- For each plot, include the hypothesis as a subtitle and a concise conclusion below the plot, presented in business language.
- Provide a short introduction at the beginning addressing the overall question you are trying to answer.
- Conclude with short takeaways, suggestions for further analysis, and potential caveats that should be considered and further investigated.

---

**Design Principles:**
- Use modern, minimalist design
- Ensure readability and clarity
- Include only libraries available to Claude
- Make the dashboard self-contained (no external dependencies)

---

**Analysis Process:**
1. Explore available data
   - Examine relevant tables and their relationships
   - Identify key data points available
   - Assess data completeness

2. Initial consultation
   - Share preliminary findings with user
   - Discuss potential analysis directions
   - Align on priorities

3. Detailed analysis
   - Execute targeted queries
   - Create visualizations
   - Document insights

4. Recommendations
   - Summarize key findings
   - Suggest next steps

To begin the analysis, first explore the available data relevant to the topic and share what you find with the user. Then, discuss potential directions for deeper analysis based on their specific interests and the available data.

IMPORTANT: NEVER USE PLACEHOLDER DATA OR ESTIMATES. EVERY NUMBER YOU USE MUST BE BASED ON THE DATABASE UNLESS THE USER EXPLICITLY STATES OTHERWISE.

# Task 3: Clean Remaining Try/Catch Patterns

## Strategic Objective
Systematically eliminate all remaining try/catch blocks from core dr_plotter logic, ensuring consistent fail-fast behavior throughout the codebase and completing the defensive programming elimination.

## Problem Context
After removing the graceful error handler and validation wrappers, there may be additional try/catch patterns scattered throughout the core library that mask problems or add defensive complexity. A systematic sweep is needed to ensure complete elimination.

## Requirements & Constraints

### Must Remove
- All try/catch blocks in `src/dr_plotter/` directory core logic
- Defensive error handling patterns that mask real problems
- Catch-and-re-raise patterns that add "helpful" context

### Must Preserve
- External dependency error handling (imports, matplotlib integration)
- All current functionality in success cases
- Critical system integration points

### Cannot Break
- Any working plotting workflows
- Integration with matplotlib, pandas, numpy
- Public API contracts and method signatures

## Decision Framework

**Search Strategy**: Comprehensive codebase sweep
- Focus on `src/dr_plotter/` directory only (skip examples/scripts)
- Identify each try/catch block and evaluate purpose
- Distinguish between defensive programming vs legitimate external error handling

**Elimination Criteria**:
- **Remove**: Validation wrappers, internal error recovery, catch-and-re-assert
- **Keep**: Import error handling, external library integration errors
- **Replace**: Complex error handling with simple assertions where appropriate

## Success Criteria

### Behavioral Success
- No silent failures or masked errors in core logic
- External dependency failures still surface clearly
- All plotting operations work identically to before

### Code Quality Success
- All defensive try/catch patterns eliminated from core logic
- Consistent fail-fast behavior across all components
- Clean, direct execution paths throughout

## Quality Standards
Reference `docs/processes/design_philosophy.md` for "Fail Fast, Surface Problems" principle.

**Search and Replace Process**:
1. Use `grep -r "try:" src/dr_plotter/` to find all remaining try/catch blocks
2. Evaluate each block: defensive programming vs legitimate external handling
3. Remove defensive patterns, keep only essential external error handling
4. Ensure no catch-and-re-assert patterns remain

## Adaptation Guidance

**If try/catch seems necessary**: Ask whether this represents a real external boundary or internal defensive programming

**If removing breaks functionality**: The try/catch was likely hiding a real problem that should be fixed at the source

**If external libraries need error handling**: Keep minimal, clear error handling focused on external integration points

## Documentation Requirements

**Implementation Notes**: List all try/catch blocks found, which were removed vs kept, and reasoning for any that remain.

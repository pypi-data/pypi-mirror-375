- **Market Data Retrieval:** Access to market data including contract sizes, currencies, ticker information, book
  summaries, and historical data.
- **Account Management:** Functionality to authenticate, retrieve account summaries, positions, and transaction logs.
- **Trading Operations:** Support for placing buy and sell orders, including market and limit orders, as well as bulk
  ordering.
- **Utility Functions:** Helper functions to convert timestamps, retrieve specific instruments or markets, and calculate
  margins.

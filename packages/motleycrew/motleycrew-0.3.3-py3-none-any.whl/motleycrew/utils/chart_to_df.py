    Reading methodology for bar and line charts:
    1. Identify x-axis labels/dates from left to right
    2. For each series, trace the line/bars and read y-values using grid lines as guides
    3. Align data points carefully with x-axis positions
    
    Reading methodology for pie and funnel charts:
    1. Identify the labels from the chart. Treat the labels as x axis values. If any of the pie slices lack labels, make some up. 
    2. The series values for a pie chart are the percentage of the pie slice corresponding to each label, 
    unless explicitly labeled otherwise.
    3. The series values for a funnel chart are the width of the funnel at each stage, if not explicitly labeled. 
    
    If the data points are only partially labeled, try to infer the missing values from the chart, while using 
    the labels you do have as much as possible. Consider that if there are apparently pointless
    numbers elsewhere in the image, they may be misplaced labels of the data points, at least
    for funnel and chart types. 

    For series_data: Create SeriesData objects with:
    - name: {series_names_instruction}
    - values: Numeric values as floats

    For x_axis_values: Extract all x-axis labels as strings, preserving original format.

    Data formatting:
    - Convert percentages to decimals (50% â†’ 0.5)
    - Remove currency symbols but preserve numeric values
    - Use consistent decimal precision (2-3 decimal places)

    Validation:
    - Each series must have same number of values as x_axis_values
    - The series must not be empty
    - If a value is unclear, estimate based on nearby grid lines
    
    If the image is low-resolution, do your best to read the labels and values, 
    don't just return an empty list or ask for a better image. 

    Use the StructuredPassthroughTool to provide the result."""

title: "OWL: Optimized Workforce Learning for General Multi-Agent Assistance in Real-World Task Automation"
message: "If you use OWL or find it helpful, please cite this paper."
abstract: >
  Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems show promise for
  automating real-world tasks but struggle to transfer across domains
  due to their domain-specific nature. We introduce Workforce, a
  hierarchical multi-agent framework that decouples strategic planning
  from specialized execution via a domain-agnostic Planner, a
  Coordinator, and domain-specific Worker agents. Optimized Workforce
  Learning (OWL) further improves cross-domain generalization through
  reinforcement learning from real-world feedback. Experiments on the
  GAIA benchmark show state-of-the-art open-source performance
  (69.70 %), surpassing commercial systems like Deep Research and
  approaching GPT-4o. By enabling scalable generalization and modular
  domain transfer, OWL lays a foundation for the next generation of
  general-purpose AI assistants.

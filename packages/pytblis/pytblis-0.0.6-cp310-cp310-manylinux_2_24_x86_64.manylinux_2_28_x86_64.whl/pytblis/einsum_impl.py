def einsum(*operands, out=None, optimize="greedy", **kwargs):
    """
    einsum(subscripts, *operands, out=None, order='K',
           optimize='greedy')
    Evaluates the Einstein summation convention on the operands.

    Drop-in replacement for numpy.einsum, using TBLIS for tensor contractions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    subscripts : str
        Specifies the subscripts for summation as comma separated list of
        subscript labels. An implicit (classical Einstein summation)
        calculation is performed unless the explicit indicator '->' is
        included as well as subscript labels of the precise output form.
    operands : list of array_like
        These are the arrays for the operation.
    out : ndarray, optional
        If provided, the calculation is done into this array.
    order : {'C', 'F', 'A', 'K'}, optional
        Controls the memory layout of the output. 'C' means it should
        be C contiguous. 'F' means it should be Fortran contiguous,
        'A' means it should be 'F' if the inputs are all 'F', 'C' otherwise.
        'K' means it should be as close to the layout as the inputs as
        is possible, including arbitrarily permuted axes.
        Default is 'K'.
    optimize : {'greedy', 'optimal'}, default 'greedy'
        Controls the optimization strategy used to compute the contraction.

    Returns
    -------
    output : ndarray
        The calculation based on the Einstein summation convention.

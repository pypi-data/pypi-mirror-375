XoMate AI
=========

Execute. Orchestrate. Automate.

**XoMate.AI is your autonomous execution engine—automating planning, orchestration, and execution of tasks using multiple tools to resolve user requests seamlessly.**

For professionals, teams, and innovators who need more than just chat-based AI, xomate.ai is an intelligent automation agent that plans, coordinates, and executes tasks across multiple tools. Unlike basic AI chatbots, xomate.ai doesn’t just answer—it gets things done.

Core Messaging
--------------

Elevator Pitch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

xomate.ai is an automation-first AI agent that takes your goals, creates a structured plan, and executes it by orchestrating multiple tools. It goes beyond conversation—delivering real results.

Value Propositions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*   **Execute**: Automatically carry out tasks from start to finish.
*   **Orchestrate**: Seamlessly coordinate multiple tools and APIs.
*   **Automate**: Save time and effort by letting xomate.ai handle complex workflows.

Key Differentiators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*   Built on the `agentmake.ai <https://github.com/eliranwong/agentmake>`_ framework, proven through `LetMeDoIt.AI <https://github.com/eliranwong/letmedoit>`_, `ToolMate.AI <https://github.com/eliranwong/toolmate>`_ and `TeamGen AI <https://github.com/eliranwong/teamgenai>`_.
*   Execution-focused, not just advisory.
*   Flexible integration with existing tools and APIs.
*   Scalable from individual users to enterprise workflows.
*   **Versatile** – supports 16 AI backends and numerous models, leveraging the advantages of AgentMake AI.
*   **Extensible** – capable of extending functionalities by interacting with Additional AgentMake AI tools or third-party MCP (Modal Context Protocol) servers.

XoMate AI Agentic Workflow
--------------------------

1.  **XoMate AI** receives a request from a user.
2.  **XoMate AI** analyzes the request and determines that it requires multiple steps to complete.
3.  **XoMate AI** generates a ``Master Prompt`` that outlines the steps needed to complete the request.
4.  **XoMate AI** sends the ``Master Prompt`` to a supervisor agent, who reviews the prompt and provides suggestions for improvement.
5.  **XoMate AI** sends the suggestions to a tool selection agent, who selects the most appropriate tools for each step of the ``Master Prompt``.
6.  **XoMate AI** sends the selected tools and the ``Master Prompt`` to an instruction generation agent, who converts the suggestions into clear and concise instructions for an AI assistant to follow.
7.  **XoMate AI** sends the instructions to an AI assistant, who executes the instructions using the selected tools. When the selected tool is not an internal tool, built in with XoMate AI, XoMate AI calls the external tool via interacting with the MCP (Modal Context Protocol) servers, configured by users.
8.  **XoMate AI** monitors the progress of the AI assistant and provides additional suggestions or instructions as needed.
9.  Once all steps are completed, **XoMate AI** provides a concise summary of the results to the user.
10. The user receives the final response, which fully resolves their original request.

Development in Progress
-----------------------

1.  Agentic workflow developed and tested.
2.  Core code built for the agentic workflow.
3.  Tested with AgentMake AI MCP servers.

Pending
~~~~~~~

*   Build an action plan agent to handle random requests.
*   Refine code and improve effectiveness.
*   Test with third-party systems.
*   Select frequently used AgentMake AI tools to include in the main library as built-in tools.
*   Build CLI/TUI interfaces.
*   Build a web UI.
*   Test on Windows, macOS, Linux, and ChromeOS.
*   Test on Android mobile devices.

Custom Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*   options to unload some or all built-in tools
*   custom XoMate AI system prompts
*   edit master plan
*   iteration allowance
*   change tools

... more ...

Install (upcoming ...)
----------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install --upgrade xomateai

Attention: The ``xomateai`` package is currently mirroring the ``agentmakemcp`` package. Once the development of XoMate AI reaches the production stage, the actual ``xomateai`` package will be uploaded.

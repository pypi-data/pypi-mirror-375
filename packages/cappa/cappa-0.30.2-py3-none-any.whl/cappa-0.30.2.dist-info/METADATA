           TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
        
           1. Definitions.
        
              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
        
              "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
              the copyright owner that is granting the License.

              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
        
              "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
              exercising permissions granted by this License.
        
              "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
              including but not limited to software source code, documentation
              source, and configuration files.
        
              "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
              transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Cappa is a declarative command line parsing library, which uses runtime type inspection
to infer (default) CLI argument behavior, and provide automatic [help text](https://cappa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/help.html)
generation and dynamic completion generation.

It supports two different modes of execution:

* `parse`: Argparse-like parsing of the arguments into an output structure
* [invoke](https://cappa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/invoke.html): Click-like calling
  of functions based on the selected subcommand

  It also provides a [dependency injection system](https://cappa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/invoke.html#Invoke-Dependencies)
  for providing non-argument resources to the invoked commands.

And, a number of different styles of CLI declaration (which can be mixed and matched within
a given CLI):

* Classes: The fields of the class correspond to CLI arguments/subcommands
* Functions: The arguments of the function correspond to CLI arguments
* Methods: The class fields correspond to CLI arguments, and the methods correspond to subcommands
* Imperative Construction: The CLI structure can be manually/imperitavely constructed,
  rather than being inferred from the input structure

  <summary><h2>Class Based, parse</h2></summary>

  ```python
  from __future__ import annotations
  from dataclasses import dataclass, field
  from typing import Literal
  from typing_extensions import Annotated
  import cappa
  
  @dataclass
  class Example:
      # Normal types are by default inferred as positional arguments
      positional: str = "optional"
  
      # Except boolean types, which are inferred as flags
      flag: bool = False
  
      # Option that only accepts the long name
      option: Annotated[int | None, cappa.Arg(long=True, help="A number")] = None
  
      # Option accepted many times
      many_options: Annotated[
          list[Literal["one", "two", "three"]], cappa.Arg(short=True)
      ] = field(default_factory=list)
  
      # Single option, accepting many values
      three_values: Annotated[tuple[str, str, int] | None, cappa.Arg(long=True)] = None
  
  args = cappa.parse(Example, backend=cappa.backend)
  print(args)
  ```

  Produces the following CLI:

  ![help text](./docs/source/_static/example.svg)

  With examples of its usage like:

  ```bash
  $ python example.py
  Example(positional='optional', flag=False, option=None, many_options=[], three_values=None)
  
  $ python example.py foo
  Example(positional='foo', flag=False, option=None, many_options=[], three_values=None)
  
  $ python example.py --flag
  Example(positional='optional', flag=True, option=None, many_options=[], three_values=None)
  
  $ python example.py --option 4
  Example(positional="optional", flag=False, option=4, many_options=[], three_values=None)
  
  $ python example.py -m one -m three
  Example(positional='optional', flag=False, option=None, many_options=['one', 'three'], three_values=None)
  
  $ python example.py --three-values a b 4
  Example(positional='optional', flag=False, option=None, many_options=[], three_values=('a', 'b', 4))
  ```

  In this way, you can turn any dataclass-like object (with some additional
  annotations, depending on what you're looking for) into a CLI.
  
  You'll note that `cappa.parse` returns an instance of the class. This API should
  feel very familiar to `argparse`, except that you get the fully typed dataclass
  instance back instead of a raw `Namespace`.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><h2>Class Based, invoke</h2></summary>

  ["invoke" documentation](https://cappa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/invoke.html)

  The "invoke" API is meant to feel more like the experience you get when using
  `click` or `typer`. You can take the same dataclass, but register a function to
  be called on successful parsing of the command.
  
  ```python
  from dataclasses import dataclass
  import cappa
  from typing_extensions import Annotated
  
  def function(example: Example):
      print(example)
  
  @cappa.command(invoke=function)
  class Example:  # identical to original class
      positional_arg: str
      boolean_flag: bool
      single_option: Annotated[int | None, cappa.Arg(long=True)]
      multiple_option: Annotated[list[str], cappa.Arg(short=True)]
  
  
  cappa.invoke(Example)
  ```
  
  (Note the lack of the dataclass decorator. You can optionally omit or include
  it, and it will be automatically inferred).
  
  Alternatively you can make your dataclass callable, as a shorthand for an
  explicit invoke function:
  
  ```python
  @dataclass
  class Example:
      ...   # identical to original class
  
      def __call__(self):
         print(self)
  ```
  
  Note `invoke=function` can either be a reference to some callable, or a string
  module-reference to a function (which will get lazily imported and invoked).

  ## Subcommands
  
  With a single top-level command, the click-like API isn't particularly valuable
  by comparison. Click's command-centric API is primarily useful when composing a
  number of nested subcommands, and dispatching to functions based on the selected
  subcommand.
  
  ```python
  from __future__ import annotations
  from dataclasses import dataclass
  import cappa
  
  @dataclass
  class Example:
      cmd: cappa.Subcommands[Print | Fail]

  
  @dataclass
  class Print:
      loudly: bool

      def __call__(self):  # again, __call__ is shorthand for the above explicit `invoke=` form.
          if self.loudly:
              print("PRINTING!")
          else:
              print("printing!")
  
  def fail():
      raise cappa.Exit(code=self.code)

  @cappa.command(invoke=fail)
  class Fail:
      code: int
  
  cappa.invoke(Example)
  ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary><h2>Functions, invoke</h2></summary>

  Purely function-based CLIs **can** reduce the ceremony required to define a given CLI
  command. Such a CLI is exactly equivalent to a CLI defined as a dataclass with the
  function's arguments as the dataclass's fields.
  
  ```python
  import cappa
  from typing_extensions import Annotated
  
  def function(foo: int, bar: bool, option: Annotated[str, cappa.Arg(long=True)] = "opt"):
      ...
  
  
  cappa.invoke(function)
  ```
  
  There are, however, some downsides to using functions. Namely, that `function`
  has no nameable type! As such, a free function can not be easily named as a
  subcommand option (`Subcommand[Foo | Bar]`).

  You **can** define a root level function with class-based subcommands, but
  the reverse is not possible because there is no valid type you can supply in
  the subcommand union.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><h2>Methods, invoke</h2></summary>

  See also [Methods](https://cappa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/functions_and_methods.html#methods).

  ```python
  from __future__ import annotations
  from dataclasses import dataclass
  import cappa
  
  @cappa.command
  @dataclass
  class Example:
      arg: int

      @cappa.command
      def add(self, other: int) -> int:
          """Add two numbers."""
          return self.arg + some_dep
  
      @cappa.command(help="Subtract two numbers")
      def subtract(self, other: int) -> int:
          return self.arg - other
  
  cappa.invoke(Example)
  ```

  With methods, the enclosing class corresponds to the parent object CLI arguments,
  exactly like normal class based definition. Unlike with free functions, (explicitly
  annotated) methods are able to act as subcommands, who's arguments (similarly to free functions)
  act as the arguments for the subcommand.

  The above example produces a CLI like:

  ```
  Usage: example ARG {add,subtract} [-h] [--completion COMPLETION]

  Arguments
    ARG

  Subcommands
    add                        Add two numbers.
    subtract                   Subtract two numbers.
  ```

          cappa.Arg(field_name="baz", num_args=2),
      ],
      help="Short help.",
      description="Long description.",
  )

  result = cappa.parse(command, argv=["one", "2", "3"])
  ```

  All other APIs of cappa amount to scanning the provided input structure, and producing
  a `cappa.Command` structure. As such, it's equally possible for users to manually
  construct the commands themselves.

  This could also be used to extend cappa, or design even more alternative interfaces
  ([Cleo](https://github.com/python-poetry/cleo) is another, fairly different, option
  that comes to mind).

## Inspirations

Credit where credit is due

* The "Derive" API of the Rust library [Clap](https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/_derive/index.html)
  directly inspired the concept of mapping a type's fields to the shape of the CLI, by inferring
  the default behavior from introspecting types.

* Click's easy way of defining large graphs of subcommands and mapping them to functions,
  inspired the the "invoke" API of Cappa. The actual APIs dont particularly resemble one
  another, but subcommands directly triggering functions (in contrast to argparse/Clap) is
  a very nice, and natural seeming feature!

* FastAPI's `Depends` system inspired Cappa's dependency injection system. This API is
  quite natural, and makes it very easy to define a complex system of ad-hoc dependencies
  **without** the upfront wiring cost of most DI frameworks.

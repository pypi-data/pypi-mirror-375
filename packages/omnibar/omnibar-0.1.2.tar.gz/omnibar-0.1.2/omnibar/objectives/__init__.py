"""
Benchmark objectives for different evaluation scenarios.

This module contains various objective types for evaluating AI agent performance:
- BaseBenchmarkObjective: Abstract base class for all objectives
- CombinedBenchmarkObjective: Combines multiple objectives
- LLMJudgeObjective: LLM-based evaluation
- OutputBenchmarkObjective: Output-based evaluation
- PathBenchmarkObjective: Path-based evaluation
- StateBenchmarkObjective: State-based evaluation

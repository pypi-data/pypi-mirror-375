    "Summary: The Dallas Lifespan Brain Study (DLBS) is a major effort designed to understand the antecedents of preservation and decline of cognitive function at different stages of the adult lifespan, with a particular interest in the early stages of a healthy brain’s march towards Alzheimer Disease. The DLBS aims to (1) understand how brain atrophy as well as accumulation of amyloid and tau affects healthy aging and cognition, (2) understand how the brain develops “neural scaffolds” to support cognition, and also (3) develop a corpus of research on the cognitive neuroscience of middle age. We have enrolled 350 healthy adults, aged 20-89 in the study who are thoroughly characterized in terms of cognition, brain structure and brain function across the adult lifespan. At Wave 1, DLBS participants received a structural MRI with DTI, three task-based functional MRI scans, and a resting state scan on a Philips 3T scanner and extensive cognitive testing combined with a detailed psychosocial battery. Amyloid imaging, using F-18 Florbetapir was conducted on a Siemens ECAT HR PET scanner on 60% of the sample during Wave 1. The DLBS is one of the most complete studies of the aging mind that is available, particularly in the United States, and can address many important hypotheses regarding the cognitive neuroscience of aging.\n",

    "Summary: The Healthy Brain Network (HBN) intends to revolutionize child and adolescent psychiatry by providing the scientific community with a large-scale dataset of 10,000 participants through an open data-sharing model. The aggregated database will bring multimodal brain imaging, genetics, and biological samples together with a standardized deep phenotyping protocol that spans a broad range of clinically relevant psychiatric, behavioral, cognitive, and lifestyle information. Rather than the more common model of focusing on a single disorder, we will include a broad range of disorders to promote the identification of biomarkers capable of differentiating between them. This strategy will also allow scientists to evaluate and refine the boundaries between disorders from a biological perspective. The proposed sample will form the foundations on which future efforts can build longitudinal components to facilitate predictions of risk and outcome.\n",

    "Summary:Mapping the human brain is one of the great scientific challenges of the 21st century. The Human Connectome Project (HCP) has tackled key aspects of this challenge by charting the neural pathways that underlie brain function and behavior, including high-quality neuroimaging data in over 1100 healthy young adults. Using greatly improved methods for data acquisition, analysis, and sharing, the HCP has provided the scientific community with data and discoveries that greatly enhance our understanding of human brain structure, function, and connectivity and their relationships to behavior. The ‘HCP-style’ neuroimaging approach is being applied to a new generation of studies, including the Lifespan HCP and Connectomes Related to Human Disease projects. \n",

    "Summary: The PNC includes a population-based sample of over 9500 individuals from the greater Philadelphia area, ages 8-21 years who received medical care at the CHOP network. The participants presented for diverse medical conditions, ranging from a well child visit and minor problems to chronic condition management to potentially life threatening health problems. They were not ascertained through psychiatric services.  They were initially enrolled in the genetic study at CHOP’s Center for Applied Genomics (CAG). Upon assent/consent, participants were genotyped during the time of their clinical visit and provided written permission to be recontacted for studies of complex pediatric disorders. The PNC participants were selected at random after stratification by sex, age and ethnicity. The overall inclusion criteria included 1. ability to provide signed informed consent (parental consent was required for participants under age 18), 2. English language proficiency, and 3. physical and cognitive ability to participate in computerized clinical assessment and neurocognitive testing. All PNC participants were assessed neuropsychiatrically with a structured interview and completed the Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (CNB). A total of 1445 participants also received neuroimaging that included functional MRI (resting state and activated blood oxygenation-level dependent and perfusion measures with arterial spin labeling), structural MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).

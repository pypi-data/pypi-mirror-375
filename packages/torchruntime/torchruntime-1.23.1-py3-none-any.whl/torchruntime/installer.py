def get_install_commands(torch_platform, packages):
    """
    Generates pip installation commands for PyTorch and related packages based on the specified platform.

    Args:
        torch_platform (str): Target platform for PyTorch. Must be one of:
            - "cpu"
            - "cuXXX" (e.g., "cu112", "cu126")
            - "rocmXXX" (e.g., "rocm4.2", "rocm6.2")
            - "xpu"
            - "directml"
            - "ipex"
        packages (list of str): List of package names (and optionally versions in pip format). Examples:
            - ["torch", "torchvision"]
            - ["torch>=2.0", "torchaudio==0.16.0"]

    Returns:
        list of list of str: Each sublist contains a pip install command (excluding the `pip install` prefix).
            Examples:
            - [["torch", "--index-url", "https://foo.com/whl"]]
            - [["torch-directml"], ["torch", "torchvision"]]

    Raises:
        ValueError: If an unsupported platform is provided.

    Notes:
        - For "xpu" on Windows, if torchvision or torchaudio are included, the function switches to nightly builds.
        - For "directml", the "torch-directml" package is returned as part of the installation commands.
        - For "ipex", the "intel-extension-for-pytorch" package is returned as part of the installation commands.

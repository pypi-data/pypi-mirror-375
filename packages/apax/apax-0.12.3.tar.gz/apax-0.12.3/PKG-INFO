`apax`[^1][^2] is a high-performance, extendable package for training of and inference with atomistic neural networks.
It implements the Gaussian Moment Neural Network model [^3][^4].
It is based on [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and uses [JaxMD](https://github.com/jax-md/jax-md) as a molecular dynamics engine.


## Installation

Apax is available on PyPI with a CPU version of JAX.

```bash
pip install apax
```

If you want to enable GPU support (only on Linux), please run
```bash
pip install "apax[cuda]"
```

For more detailed instructions, please refer to the [documentation](https://apax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Usage

### Your first apax Model

In order to train a model, you need to run

```bash
apax train config.yaml
```

We offer some input file templates to get new users started as quickly as possible.
Simply run the following commands and add the appropriate entries in the marked fields

```bash
apax template train # use --full for a template with all input options
```

Please refer to the [documentation](https://apax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for a detailed explanation of all parameters.
The documentation can convenienty be accessed by running `apax docs`.

## Molecular Dynamics

There are two ways in which `apax` models can be used for molecular dynamics out of the box.
High performance NVT simulations using JaxMD can be started with the CLI by running

```bash
apax md config.yaml md_config.yaml
```

A template command for MD input files is provided as well.

The second way is to use the ASE calculator provided in `apax.md`.


## Input File Auto-Completion

use the following command to generate JSON schemata for training and MD configuration files:

```bash
apax schema
```

If you are using VSCode, you can utilize them to lint and autocomplete your input files.
The command creates the 2 schemata and adds them to the projects `.vscode/settings.json`

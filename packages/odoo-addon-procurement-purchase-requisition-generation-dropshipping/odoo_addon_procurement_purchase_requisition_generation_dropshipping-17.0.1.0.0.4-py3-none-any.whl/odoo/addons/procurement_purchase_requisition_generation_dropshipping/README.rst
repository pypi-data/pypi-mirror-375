This module creates the link between the purchase requisition and
dropshipping applications.

It sets the shipping address and picking type on purchase orders created
from purchase agreements, and links them with the originating sale
order.

Usage
=====

- Create a storable product with the ``dropship`` route and set
  Procurement as ``Propose a call for tenders``.
- Create a sale order and select this product.
- Confirm the sale order.
- Go to Purchase > Blanket orders and search for the record generated by
  the sale order.
- Confirm the purchase agreement and generate a new purchase order.
- The purchase order must have the ``picking type`` set as dropship, and
  the ``Dropship address`` must be the customer from the sale order.

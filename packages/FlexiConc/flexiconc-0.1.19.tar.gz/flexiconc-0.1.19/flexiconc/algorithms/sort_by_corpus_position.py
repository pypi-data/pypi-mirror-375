def sort_by_corpus_position(conc, **args):
    """
    Sorts the concordance or subset of data by line_id, which corresponds to the corpus position.

    Args are dynamically validated and extracted from the schema.

    Parameters:
    - conc (Union[Concordance, ConcordanceSubset]): The full concordance or a subset of it.
    - args (dict): Arguments include:
        - No additional arguments are required for this function.

    Returns:
    - dict: A dictionary containing:

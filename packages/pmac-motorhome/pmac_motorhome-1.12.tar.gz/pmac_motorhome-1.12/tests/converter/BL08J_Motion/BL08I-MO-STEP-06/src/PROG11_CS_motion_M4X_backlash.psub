; In order to do the backlash correction, have to use a different motion 
; programme.
; Using the one written for BL24I DCM.  It requires the co-ordinate system
; inverse kinematic to be modified to have the backlash distances set by 
; this programme to be taken into account.
;
; Conversation with Emma who wrote it to explain how and why it works and
; Brian to understand what the Delta Tau is doing.
; First it notes the start position of the motors.
; Then it demands the first of three moves, to the target position - because the
; kinematics knows where this is for the underlying motors, but the programme
; cannot.
; Then it looks at the motor current and start positions to decide whether
; correction is needed depending on the size, direction, position, resolution.
; If correction is needed, it sets the BDST Q variable to be picked up by the
; kinematics and then moves to the backlash correction position.  Finally it
; resets the BDST q-variable to zero and demands the final move to the target position.
;
; It controls the speed of the moves using the feedrate of the co-ordinate system
; (Isx89 in units of Isx90 - Isx89 is set by the motor record - it becomes the velocity 
; field on the co-ordinate system motor record).  It is only the motion programme which 
; can set the feedrate to control the moves.  This is why the functionality is split 
; between the motion programme and the co-ordinate system which have to work together.

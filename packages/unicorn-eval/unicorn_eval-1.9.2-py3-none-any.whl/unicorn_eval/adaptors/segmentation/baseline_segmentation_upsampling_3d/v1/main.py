class SegmentationUpsampling3D(PatchLevelTaskAdaptor):
    """
    Patch-level adaptor that trains a 3D upsampling decoder for segmentation.

    This adaptor takes precomputed patch-level features from 3D medical images
    and performs segmentation by training a decoder that upsamples the features
    back to voxel space.

    Steps:
    1. Extract patch-level segmentation labels using spatial metadata.
    2. Construct training data from patch features and coordinates.
    3. Train a 3D upsampling decoder to predict voxel-wise segmentation from patch embeddings.
    4. At inference, apply the trained decoder to test patch features and reconstruct full-size predictions.

    Args:
        shot_features : Patch-level feature embeddings of few shots used for for training.
        shot_labels : Full-resolution segmentation labels.
        shot_coordinates : Patch coordinates corresponding to shot_features.
        shot_names : Case identifiers for few shot patches.
        test_features : Patch-level feature embeddings for testing.
        test_coordinates : Patch coordinates corresponding to test_features.
        test_names : Case identifiers for testing patches.
        test_image_sizes, test_image_origins, test_image_spacings, test_image_directions:
            Metadata for reconstructing full-size test predictions.
        shot_image_spacing, shot_image_origins, shot_image_directions:
            Metadata for extracting training labels at patch-level.
        patch_size : Size of each 3D patch.
        return_binary : Whether to threshold predictions to binary masks.
        balance_bg : Whether to balance background and foreground patches using inverse probability weighting.

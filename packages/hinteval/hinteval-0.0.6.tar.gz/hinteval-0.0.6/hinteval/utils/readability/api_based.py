        the readability on a scale from very easy to very hard. Base your scores off the
        CEFR scale for L2 Learners. You should use the following key:

        1 = Can understand very short, simple texts a single phrase at a time, picking up
        familiar names, words and basic phrases and rereading as required.
        2 = Can understand short, simple texts on familiar matters of a concrete type
        3 = Can read straightforward factual texts on subjects related to his/her field
        and interest with a satisfactory level of comprehension.
        4 = Can read with a large degree of independence, adapting style and speed of
        reading to different texts and purpose
        5 = Can understand in detail lengthy, complex texts, whether or not they relate
        to his/her own area of speciality, provided he/she can reread difficult sections.
        6 = Can understand and interpret critically virtually all forms of the written
        language including abstract, structurally complex, or highly colloquial literary
        and non-literary writings.

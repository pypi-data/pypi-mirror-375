## Introduction

SlideDown is a terminal-based presentation application built with Python and the Textual framework. It allows you to create, edit, and view Markdown-based presentations directly from your terminal. With SlideDown, you can quickly create professional-looking presentations without leaving the comfort of your command line.

## Installation

To install SlideDown, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install slidedown
```

Alternatively, you can clone the repository and install it manually:

```bash

pip install -e .
```

## Getting Started

Once SlideDown is installed, you can start the application by running:

This will launch the SlideDown interface in your terminal, where you can begin creating and managing your presentations.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Error: 'NoneType' object is not callable**
   - This usually occurs when the application is not properly initialized. Make sure you're running the application with the correct command: `slidedown`

2. **Duplicate Widget ID Error**
   - This can happen when updating project widgets. The application has been fixed to prevent this issue by ensuring unique IDs for all widgets.

3. **File Not Found Errors**
   - Make sure the file path you're trying to access exists and is readable.
   - Check that you have the necessary permissions to access the file.

4. **CSS Parsing Errors**
   - The application uses a custom CSS-like syntax for styling. Some CSS properties might not be supported. The application has been tested with the included CSS, but custom modifications might cause errors.

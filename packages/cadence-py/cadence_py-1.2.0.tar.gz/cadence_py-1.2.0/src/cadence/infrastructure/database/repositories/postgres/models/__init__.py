"""Database Models for Cadence Framework.

This module provides SQLAlchemy ORM models that implement optimized storage
for the Cadence multi-agent AI framework. The models store only user input + final AI response
(not intermediate LangGraph steps) achieving significant storage reduction while maintaining
full conversation context capability.

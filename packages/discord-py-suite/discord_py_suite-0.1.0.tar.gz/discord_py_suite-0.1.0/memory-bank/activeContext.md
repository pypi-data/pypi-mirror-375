#### Advanced Moderation Expansion (`src/tools/moderation.py`)
- **Expanded from 2 to 17 tools**: Added timeout, warnings, bulk operations, moderation logging

**Total Tool Count Achieved**: 56 tools (2+5+2+1+17+9+12+8)

## Reference Repositories Analysis (Now Background)
### mcp-discord-forum
- Language: Likely Python/TypeScript MCP implementation
- Focus: Discord forum management tools (currently lower priority)

### discord-mcp-rest
- Language: Likely TypeScript/JavaScript REST-based implementation
- Focus: HTTP REST API Discord operations (reference for future phases)

## Current Implementation Status
**Completed Implementations (Post-Phase 2):**
- **8 Tool Modules** instead of the previously documented 5
- **56 Active Tools** across all categories
- **Full Moderation Automation** with advanced features
- **Complete Role Lifecycle Management**
- **Integrated Webhook Support**
- **Voice Channel Administration**

**Architecture Solidified:**
- JSON Schema validation for tool parameters
- Consistent error handling across all new modules
- Modular registration pattern maintained
- Async/await operations properly implemented

## Phase 3 Planning: Gateway Integration & Real-time Features

## Next Steps for Phase 3

### Immediate Objectives (Week 1-2)
1. **Gateway Extensions Completion**:
   - Finalize event buffering system in `src/gateway/event_buffer.py`
   - Implement event filtering logic in `src/gateway/event_filter.py`  
   - Complete gateway manager integration in `src/gateway/manager.py`
   - Enable real-time event processing

2. **Security Layers Implementation**:
   - Build confirmation dialog system in `src/security/confirmation.py`
   - Complete policy enforcement rules in `src/security/policy.py`
   - Expand security validation for tool operations

### Medium-term Goals (Week 3-6)
3. **Forum Tools Implementation**:
   - Thread creation and management tools
   - Forum post operations
   - Thread archiving and locking
   - Forum channel organization

4. **Audit Tools Development**:
   - Server audit log retrieval system
   - Audit event filtering and monitoring  
   - Audit archive operations
   - Compliance reporting capabilities

### Long-term Vision (Week 7-10)
5. **Scalability Enhancements**:
   - Performance optimizations for high-volume servers
   - Rate limiting improvements
   - Connection pooling expansion
   - Memory efficiency upgrades

6. **Enterprise Features**:
   - Multi-server management capabilities
   - Team collaboration features
   - Administrative dashboards
   - Compliance and governance tools

## Architectural Decisions and Considerations

### Gateway Integration Strategy
- Implement event-driven architecture for real-time Discord interactions
- Build scalable event buffering with configurable filters
- Ensure thread-safe operation for concurrent event handling
- Maintain backwards compatibility with existing synchronous tools

### Security Framework Design  
- Role-based access control with granular permissions
- Confirmation flows for destructive operations
- Audit trails for all administrative actions
- Secure webhook token handling

### Performance Optimizations
- Optimize event processing to minimize latency
- Implement smart caching for frequently accessed data
- Add connection state monitoring for reliability
- Resource cleanup for long-running processes

## Critical Dependencies and Integration Points
- Discord.py v2.3+ for gateway event access
- FastMCP framework compatibility for event streaming
- uv 0.1+ package management for dependency handling  
- Python 3.11+ async capabilities for concurrent processing

## Risk Mitigation
- **Gateway Complexity**: Incrementally implement gateway features with comprehensive testing
- **Performance Impact**: Monitor memory usage and response times during gateway operations
- **Bot Permissions**: Ensure proper intent configuration for event access
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement intelligent backoff strategies for API calls

## Success Criteria for Phase 3
- Gateway integration provides real-time event streaming
- Security layers prevent unauthorized operations
- Forum and audit tools enhance administrative capabilities
- Overall system performance maintained above 95% efficiency
- Comprehensive test coverage for new functionality

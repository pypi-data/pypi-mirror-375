; PLC for putting PMAC into defined state at startup
; Original Author: Micromech
; Used variables: i5112, (P101..P132 reserved for CS mres)
; Macros (and values): 
; PLC2 = ENABLE ; Enable or disable PLC2
; ...
; PLC31 = DISABLE ; Enable or disable PLC31
; CMDS =  ;Extra commands to run after PLCS are started
; This PLC will make sure a PMAC is in a known state at startup by resetting 
; UMACs, clearing macro ring faults, zeroing axis positions, defining some 
; lookahead buffers, and enabling/disabling PLCs. After first run, it will just 
; define the buffers and enable/disable PLCs
;
; NB Needs either PMAC_M_variables.pmc loaded

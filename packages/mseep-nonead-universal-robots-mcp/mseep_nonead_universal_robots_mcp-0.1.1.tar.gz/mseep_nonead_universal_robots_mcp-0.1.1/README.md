## 6. Technical Architecture  

MCP adopts a client-server architecture, enabling standardized communication between models and external resources.
![pic alt](./images/MCP.svg "mcp")
### Client-Server Model  
The MCP architecture consists of the following core components:  

- **MCP Host**: The LLM application (e.g., Claude Desktop or IDE) that initiates connections and seeks to access data via MCP.  
- **MCP Client**: A protocol client embedded within the host application, maintaining a 1:1 connection with the server.  
- **MCP Server**: A lightweight program that exposes specific functionalities through the standardized Model Context Protocol.  
- **Local Data Sources**: Computer files, databases, and services that the MCP server can securely access.  
- **Remote Services**: External systems (e.g., APIs) accessible via the internet that the MCP server can connect to.  

### Core Responsibilities  
In the MCP architecture, each component has the following responsibilities:  

**MCP Host:**  
- Provides the user interface  
- Manages connections with LLM providers  
- Integrates the MCP client to access external resources  

**MCP Client:**  
- Establishes and maintains connections with the MCP server  
- Sends requests and receives responses  
- Handles data exchange in compliance with the MCP protocol standards  

**MCP Server:**  
- Processes requests from clients  
- Executes specific functions or provides access to resources  
- Formats responses according to the MCP protocol standards  

### Communication Protocol  
MCP uses **JSON-RPC 2.0** as its foundational communication protocol, supporting the following message types:  

- **Requests**: Messages sent from the client to the server (or vice versa) to initiate operations.  
- **Responses**: Replies to requests, containing either results or error information.  
- **Notifications**: One-way messages that do not require responses, typically used for event notifications.  

MCP supports multiple transport mechanisms, including:  
- **Standard Input/Output (Stdio)**: Suitable for local servers, enabling inter-process communication.  
- **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: An HTTP-based transport mechanism for remote servers.  
![pic alt](./images/p.svg "mcp_json-RPC2.0")  
**Requests**: Messages initiating operations sent from client to server or vice versa.  
**Responses**: Replies to requests containing either results or error information.  
**Notifications**: One-way messages requiring no response, typically used for event notifications.  

MCP supports multiple transport mechanisms, including:  
- **Standard Input/Output (Stdio)**: Suitable for local servers, implemented via inter-process communication.  
- **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: An HTTP-based transport mechanism for remote servers.  

### Advantages of MCP  
MCP offers significant advantages over traditional integration methods, particularly in standardization, security, and scalability.  

**Standardization**  
MCP addresses fragmentation in traditional integration by standardizing interactions between AI systems and external data sources:  
- **Plug-and-play connectivity**: Unified protocol enables seamless integration of diverse data sources without custom coding.  
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Supports different AI models and platforms, enhancing interoperability.  
- **Simplified development**: Reduces complexity, allowing developers to focus on business logic rather than underlying integrations.  

**Security**  
MCP incorporates built-in security mechanisms to safeguard data during transmission and processing:  
- **Sensitive data protection**: Ensures secure handling of confidential information (e.g., API keys, user data).  
- **Access control**: MCP servers implement granular permissions to validate request authorization.  
- **Local processing**: Keeps sensitive data on-premises, eliminating third-party exposure risks.  

**Scalability**  
MCP's modular design delivers exceptional extensibility:  
- **Multi-service connectivity**: Supports standardized resource/tool sharing across compatible clients.  
- **Ecosystem growth**: Developers gain access to expanding libraries of pre-built components.  
- **Customization**: Enables creation of specialized MCP servers to extend system capabilities.

gpuNUFFT: MATLAB demo 

Run the script `demo/cgsense_phantom_recon.m` to see the gpuNUFFT in action. 

The scripts runs a CG-SENSE reconstruction on phantom MRI data.

To keep the package size and runtime small the coil sensitivities are
estimated in a quite rough way. Nevertheless, the main functionality 
of the gpuNUFFT MATLAB operator should be generally understandable. 

Please note that the cpu reference comparison requires Jeff Fessler's NUFFT toolbox: http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/irt/irt/nufft/.
It also makes use of Miki Lustig's class interface to the toolbox. An extension to 3D trajectories is included here with permission from the original author, as well as a copy of the orignal 2D version. It was originally included in: https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~mlustig/software/sparseMRI_v0.2.tar.gz

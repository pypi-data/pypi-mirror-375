# PM Workflow Configuration

## Mandatory Workflow Sequence

**STRICT PHASES - MUST FOLLOW IN ORDER**:

### Phase 1: Research (ALWAYS FIRST)
- Analyze requirements for structural completeness
- Identify missing specifications and ambiguities
- Surface assumptions requiring validation
- Document constraints, dependencies, and weak points
- Define falsifiable success criteria
- Output feeds directly to implementation phase

### Phase 2: Implementation (AFTER Research)
- Engineer Agent for code implementation
- Data Engineer Agent for data pipelines/ETL
- Security Agent for security implementations
- Ops Agent for infrastructure/deployment

### Phase 3: Quality Assurance (AFTER Implementation)

The PM routes QA work based on agent capabilities discovered at runtime. QA agents are selected dynamically based on their routing metadata (keywords, paths, file extensions) matching the implementation context.

**Available QA Agents** (discovered dynamically):
- **API QA Agent**: Backend/server testing (REST, GraphQL, authentication)
- **Web QA Agent**: Frontend/browser testing (UI, accessibility, responsive)  
- **General QA Agent**: Default testing (libraries, CLI tools, utilities)

**Routing Decision Process**:
1. Analyze implementation output for keywords, paths, and file patterns
2. Match against agent routing metadata from templates
3. Select agent(s) with highest confidence scores
4. For multiple matches, execute by priority (specialized before general)
5. For full-stack changes, run specialized agents sequentially

**Dynamic Routing Benefits**:
- Agent capabilities always current (pulled from templates)
- New QA agents automatically available when deployed
- Routing logic centralized in agent templates
- No duplicate documentation to maintain

The routing metadata in each agent template defines:
- `keywords`: Trigger words that indicate this agent should be used
- `paths`: Directory patterns that match this agent's expertise
- `extensions`: File types this agent specializes in testing
- `priority`: Execution order when multiple agents match
- `confidence_threshold`: Minimum score for agent selection

See deployed agent capabilities via agent discovery for current routing details.

**CRITICAL Requirements**:
- QA Agent MUST receive original user instructions for context
- Validation against acceptance criteria defined in user request
- Edge case testing and error scenarios for robust implementation
- Performance and security validation where applicable
- Clear, standardized output format for tracking and reporting

### Phase 4: Documentation (ONLY after QA sign-off)
- API documentation updates
- User guides and tutorials
- Architecture documentation
- Release notes

**Override Commands** (user must explicitly state):
- "Skip workflow" - bypass standard sequence
- "Go directly to [phase]" - jump to specific phase
- "No QA needed" - skip quality assurance
- "Emergency fix" - bypass research phase

## Structural Task Delegation Format

```
Task: <Specific, measurable action with falsifiable outcome>
Agent: <Specialized Agent Name>
Structural Requirements:
  Objective: <Measurable outcome without emotional framing>
  Inputs: <Files, data, dependencies with validation criteria>
  Falsifiable Success Criteria: 
    - <Testable criterion 1 with pass/fail condition>
    - <Testable criterion 2 with measurable threshold>
  Known Limitations: <Documented constraints and assumptions>
  Testing Requirements: MANDATORY - Provide execution logs
  Constraints:
    Performance: <Specific metrics: latency < Xms, memory < YMB>
    Architecture: <Structural patterns required>
    Security: <Specific validation requirements>
    Timeline: <Hard deadline with consequences>
  Dependencies: <Required prerequisites with validation>
  Identified Risks: <Structural weak points and failure modes>
  Missing Requirements: <Gaps identified in specification>
  Verification: Provide falsifiable evidence of all criteria met
```


### Research-First Scenarios

Delegate to Research for structural analysis when:
- Requirements lack falsifiable criteria
- Technical approach has multiple valid paths
- Integration points have unclear contracts
- Assumptions need validation
- Architecture has identified weak points
- Domain constraints are ambiguous
- Dependencies have uncertain availability

### ðŸ”´ MANDATORY Ticketing Agent Integration ðŸ”´

**THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL - ALL WORK MUST BE TRACKED IN TICKETS**

The PM MUST create and maintain tickets for ALL user requests. Failure to track work in tickets is a CRITICAL VIOLATION of PM protocols.

**IMPORTANT**: The ticketing system uses `aitrackdown` CLI directly, NOT `claude-mpm tickets` commands.

**ALWAYS delegate to Ticketing Agent when user mentions:**
- "ticket", "tickets", "ticketing"
- "epic", "epics"  
- "issue", "issues"
- "task tracking", "task management"
- "project documentation"
- "work breakdown"
- "user stories"

**AUTOMATIC TICKETING WORKFLOW** (when ticketing is requested):

#### Session Initialization
1. **Single Session Work**: Delegate to Ticketing Agent for ISS creation
   - Command: `aitrackdown create issue "Title" --description "Structural requirements: [list]"`
   - Document falsifiable acceptance criteria
   - Transition: `aitrackdown transition ISS-XXXX in-progress`
   
2. **Multi-Session Work**: Delegate to Ticketing Agent for EP creation
   - Command: `aitrackdown create epic "Title" --description "Objective: [measurable outcome]"`
   - Define success metrics and constraints
   - Create ISS with `--issue EP-XXXX` linking to parent

#### Phase Tracking
After EACH workflow phase completion, delegate to Ticketing Agent to:

1. **Create TSK (Task) ticket** for the completed phase:
   - **Research Phase**: `aitrackdown create task "Research findings" --issue ISS-XXXX`
   - **Implementation Phase**: `aitrackdown create task "Code implementation" --issue ISS-XXXX`
   - **QA Phase**: `aitrackdown create task "Testing results" --issue ISS-XXXX`
   - **Documentation Phase**: `aitrackdown create task "Documentation updates" --issue ISS-XXXX`
   
2. **Update parent ISS ticket** with:
   - Comment: `aitrackdown comment ISS-XXXX "Phase completion summary"`
   - Transition status: `aitrackdown transition ISS-XXXX [status]`
   - Valid statuses: open, in-progress, ready, tested, blocked

3. **Task Ticket Content** must include:
   - Agent that performed the work
   - Measurable outcomes achieved
   - Falsifiable criteria met/unmet
   - Structural decisions with justification
   - Files modified with specific changes
   - Root causes of blockers (not symptoms)
   - Assumptions made and validation status
   - Identified gaps or weak points

#### Continuous Updates
- **After significant changes**: `aitrackdown comment ISS-XXXX "Progress update"`
- **When blockers arise**: `aitrackdown transition ISS-XXXX blocked`
- **On completion**: `aitrackdown transition ISS-XXXX tested` or `ready`

#### Ticket Hierarchy Example
```
EP-0001: Authentication System Overhaul (Epic)
â””â”€â”€ ISS-0001: Implement OAuth2 Support (Session Issue)
    â”œâ”€â”€ TSK-0001: Research OAuth2 patterns and existing auth (Research Agent)
    â”œâ”€â”€ TSK-0002: Implement OAuth2 provider integration (Engineer Agent)
    â”œâ”€â”€ TSK-0003: Test OAuth2 implementation (QA Agent)
    â””â”€â”€ TSK-0004: Document OAuth2 setup and API (Documentation Agent)
```

The Ticketing Agent specializes in:
- Creating and managing epics, issues, and tasks using aitrackdown CLI
- Using proper commands: `aitrackdown create issue/task/epic`
- Updating tickets: `aitrackdown transition`, `aitrackdown comment`
- Tracking project progress with `aitrackdown status tasks`
- Maintaining clear audit trail of all work performed

### Structural Ticket Creation Delegation

When delegating to Ticketing Agent, specify commands with analytical content:
- **Create Issue**: "Use `aitrackdown create issue 'Title' --description 'Requirements: [list], Constraints: [list], Success criteria: [measurable]'`"
- **Create Task**: "Use `aitrackdown create task 'Title' --issue ISS-XXXX` with verification criteria"
- **Update Status**: "Use `aitrackdown transition ISS-XXXX [status]` with justification"
- **Add Comment**: "Use `aitrackdown comment ISS-XXXX 'Structural update: [metrics and gaps]'`"

### Ticket-Based Work Resumption

**Tickets replace session resume for work continuation**:
- Check for open tickets: `aitrackdown status tasks --filter "status:in-progress"`
- Show ticket details: `aitrackdown show ISS-XXXX`
- Resume work on existing tickets rather than starting new ones
- Use ticket history to understand context and progress
- This ensures continuity across sessions and PMs

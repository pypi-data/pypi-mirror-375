# Synapse Programming Language

**Created by Michael Benjamin Crowe**

A proprietary programming language designed for deep scientific reasoning and enhanced parallel thought processing pipelines.

## Overview

Synapse is a domain-specific language that combines:
- **Parallel execution streams** for simultaneous hypothesis testing
- **Uncertainty quantification** built into the type system
- **Scientific reasoning chains** with formal logic constructs
- **Native tensor operations** for high-dimensional data
- **Hypothesis-driven programming** paradigm

## Key Features

### 1. Uncertainty-Aware Computing
```synapse
uncertain measurement = 42.3 Â± 0.5
uncertain temperature = 300 Â± 10
// Uncertainty propagates automatically through calculations
```

### 2. Parallel Thought Streams
```synapse
parallel {
    branch A: test_hypothesis_1()
    branch B: test_hypothesis_2()
    branch C: control_experiment()
}
```

### 3. Reasoning Chains
```synapse
reason chain ScientificMethod {
    premise P1: "Observable phenomenon exists"
    derive D1 from P1: "Hypothesis can be formed"
    conclude: D1 => "Experiment validates or refutes"
}
```

## Running Tests

```bash
cd synapse-lang
python test_synapse.py
```

## Example Programs

### Quantum Simulation
Demonstrates parallel evolution of quantum states with uncertainty:
```synapse
experiment DoubleSlitSimulation {
    parallel {
        branch slit_A: evolve_wavefunction(path="A")
        branch slit_B: evolve_wavefunction(path="B")
    }
    synthesize: compute_interference(slit_A, slit_B)
}
```

### Climate Modeling
Complex system analysis with ensemble runs:
```synapse
parallel {
    branch RCP2.6: model_pathway(emissions="low")
    branch RCP4.5: model_pathway(emissions="moderate")
    branch RCP8.5: model_pathway(emissions="high")
}
```

### Drug Discovery
Molecular simulation pipeline with parallel screening:
```synapse
pipeline DrugDiscovery {
    stage VirtualScreening parallel(64) {
        fork {
            path ligand_docking: autodock_vina
            path ml_prediction: graph_neural_network
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Status

âœ… **Completed:**
- Basic lexer/tokenizer
- Token types for scientific operators
- Uncertain value arithmetic with error propagation
- Parallel execution framework
- Variable storage and retrieval
- Example scientific programs

ðŸš§ **In Progress:**
- Full parser implementation
- Advanced reasoning chains
- Tensor operations
- Symbolic mathematics
- Pipeline execution

## Design Philosophy

Synapse is designed to express scientific thinking naturally:
1. **Hypothesis-first**: Start with assumptions, derive conclusions
2. **Parallel exploration**: Test multiple theories simultaneously  
3. **Uncertainty-native**: Propagate measurement errors automatically
4. **Reasoning chains**: Build formal logical arguments
5. **Pipeline-oriented**: Structure complex workflows

Helper functions to read rename directives file(s) and return them as a tuple to the caller
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These helper function expect a text file in csv format with 4 columns:

- Current family name: with out the file extension
- File path	: fully qualified file path to the family file.
- Family category: the Revit category of the family.
- New family name: the new family name without the file extension.

- First row is treated as a header row and its content is ignored.

The test which works off the residuals generated during the model validation / model selection processing phase.  As mentioned previously, typically the data scientists divide their series sample set into two portions: the first portion to be used for the 'model fitting' exercise; and, the second portion to be used for the 'model validation' exercise.  The TD_SIGNIF_PERIODICITIES function is usually executed against the residuals produced during the second 'model validation' exercise, meaning against the 'in-sample' forecasted data points."

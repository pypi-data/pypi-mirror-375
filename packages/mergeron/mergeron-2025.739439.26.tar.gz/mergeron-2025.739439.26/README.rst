*Visualize* the sets of mergers falling within specified concentration and diversion-ratio thresholds.  *Analyze* merger investigations data published by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission in various reports on extended merger investigations (Second Requests) during 1996 to 2011.
*Generate* data under specified distributions of firm counts, market shares, price-cost margins, and prices, optionally imposing equilibrium conditions for Bertrand oligopoly with MNL demand and restrictions implied by statutory filing thresholds. *Compute* intrinsic enforcement rates or intrinsic clearance rates using generated data, with bounds for
concentration;
diversion ratio;
gross upward pricing pressure (GUPPI);
critical marginal cost reduction (CMCR); and
illustrative price rise (IPR).

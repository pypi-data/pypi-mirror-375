# charmlibs-interfaces

This package should not be installed - it exists solely to reserve the `charmlibs.interfaces` namespace.

This namespace is for packages designed to be used by [Juju charms](https://juju.is/charms-architecture) to implement [relations](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/ops/latest/howto/manage-relations/), known as charm interface libraries. Read the [charmlibs documentation](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/charmlibs) for more information about charm libraries.

Welcome to gen-trie's documentation!
====================================

**gen-trie** is a Python library for creating and manipulating
'generalized' trie data structures.

Unlike common trie implementations that only support strings as keys, this
generalized trie can handle various types of tokens in keys, as long as they are hashable.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to do :ref:`gentrie-installation` of the project.

.. note::

   This project is under active development and the API is still subject to change.
   Please refer to the documentation for the most up-to-date information.

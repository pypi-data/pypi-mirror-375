# Introduction

---

B24PySDK is the official library for working with the Bitrix24 REST API in Python.

It offers following advantages:
1. Supports authorization via tokens and webhooks;
2. Allows to pass arguments and retreive response data as native Python types;
3. Utilizes type hints to show possible method arguments and their types;
4. Checks that passed arguments have valid types.

# Documentation

The REST API documentation can be found on [Bitrix24 REST API](https://apidocs.bitrix24.com/).

# Quickstart

---

This section provides a short guide to help you get started with B24PySDK.

The following examples illustrate common scenarios when using the library.
## Calling an API method

---

To call Bitrix API, import Client and BitrixWebhook or BitrixToken classes from the library and create class objects.
There are two ways of calling API methods via library.
1. Using a permanent incoming local webhook code: https://apidocs.bitrix24.com/local-integrations/local-webhooks.html

```python
from b24pysdk import BitrixWebhook, Client

bitrix_token = BitrixWebhook(domain="your_bitrix_portal", auth_token="key_of_your_webhook")
client = Client(bitrix_token)
```

2. Using a temporary OAuth 2.0 authorization token: https://apidocs.bitrix24.com/api-reference/oauth/index.html

```python
from b24pysdk import BitrixToken, Client, BitrixApp

bitrix_app = BitrixApp(client_id="app_code", client_secret="app_key")
bitrix_token = BitrixToken(
    domain="your_bitrix_portal", 
    auth_token="key_of_your_webhook", 
    refresh_token="refresh_token_of_the_app", # optional parameter
    bitrix_app=bitrix_app,
)
client = Client(bitrix_token)
```

Client class is your access point to the API. All supported methods can be called using properties of created instance.

For example, to get a description of deal fields we can use REST method crm.deal.fields like so:
```python
response = client.crm.deal.fields()
```

## Passing parameters in API calls

---

Most of Bitrix REST API methods allow you to pass some arguments to them. In order to send them using SDK, simply pass these arguments as positional or named arguments to the corresponding Python function.

To illustrate, we can update a deal by calling: 
```python
response = client.crm.deal.get(bitrix_id=2)
```

## Retrieving results of the call

---

B24PySDK uses deferred method calls. To invoke a method and obtain its result, access the corresponding property. 
The JSON response retrieved from the server is automatically parsed and stored in an object: 
response.result contains the value returned by the API method, while response.time provides the execution time of the request.
```python
from b24pysdk import BitrixWebhook, Client

bitrix_token = BitrixWebhook(domain="your_bitrix_portal", auth_token="key_of_your_webhook")
client = Client(bitrix_token)

response = client.crm.deal.update(bitrix_id=10, fields={'TITLE': 'New title'})
print(f'Updated successfully: {response.result}')
print(f'Call took {response.time.duration} seconds')
```
```
Updated successfully: True
Call took 0.40396690368652344 seconds
```

### Retrieving records with list methods

For list methods, you can use .as_list() and .as_list_fast() to explicitly retrieve all records.
> Documentation: https://apidocs.bitrix24.com/api-reference/performance/huge-data.html

By default, calling .list() returns up to 50 records only.
```python
response = client.crm.deal.list()
deals = response.result  # up to 50 records
```

The .as_list() method retrieves all records by automatically.
```python
response = client.crm.deal.list()
deals = response.as_list().result  # full list of records
```

The .as_list_fast() method is optimized for large datasets. 
It uses a more efficient algorithm and is recommended when receiving many records.
```python
response = client.crm.deal.list()
deals = response.as_list_fast().result  # generator
for deal in deals:  # requests are made lazily during iteration
    print(deal)
```

## Library use via abstract classes

Instead of BitrixApp and BitrixToken, you can use their abstract class versions with frameworks and ORM libraries.
When using these abstract classes, the programmer is responsible for declaring the instance attributes and storing them.

Examples of the available abstract classes are AbstractBitrixApp, AbstractBitrixAppLocal, AbstractBitrixToken and AbstractBitrixTokenLocal.

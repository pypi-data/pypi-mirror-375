Pyrefly is a static type checker for Python that helps you catch type-related
errors before your code runs. It analyzes your Python code to ensure type
consistency throughout your codebase, making your applications more reliable and
easier to maintain. Pyrefly supports both IDE integration and CLI usage, giving
you flexibility in how you incorporate type checking into your workflow.

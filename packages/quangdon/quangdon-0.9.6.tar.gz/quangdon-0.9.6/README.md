# quangdon
quangdon is a G2P engine designed for [vansarah](https://github.com/mr-don88/vansarah) models.

Hosted demo: https://hf.co/spaces/mr-don88/quangdon-G2P

### English Usage
You can run this in one cell on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/):
```py
!pip install -q "quangdon[en]"

from quangdon import en

g2p = en.G2P(trf=False, british=False, fallback=None) # no transformer, American English

text = '[quangdon](/kw…ë≈ãÀàd…ën/) is a G2P engine designed for [vansarah](/v√¶nÀàs√¶r…ô/) models.'

phonemes, tokens = g2p(text)

print(phonemes) # kw…ë≈ãÀàd…ën …™z …ô  §Ààit…ôpÀài Àà…õn §…ôn d…ôzÀàInd f…î…π v√¶nÀàs√¶r…ô mÀà…ëd·µälz.
```

To fallback to espeak:
```py
# Installing espeak varies across platforms, this silent install works on Colab:
!apt-get -qq -y install espeak-ng > /dev/null 2>&1

!pip install -q "quangdon[en]" phonemizer-fork

from quangdon import en, espeak

fallback = espeak.EspeakFallback(british=False) # en-us

g2p = en.G2P(trf=False, british=False, fallback=fallback) # no transformer, American English

text = 'Now outofdictionary words are handled by espeak.'

phonemes, tokens = g2p(text)

print(phonemes) # nÀàW W…æ…ëfdÀà…™k É…ônÀå…õ…πi wÀà…ú…πdz …ë…π hÀà√¶nd…ôld bI Ààispik.

### Japanese
The second gen Japanese tokenizer now uses pyopenjtalk with full unidic, enabling pitch accent marks and improved phrase merging. Deep gratitude to [@sophiefy](https://github.com/sophiefy) for invaluable recommendations and nuanced help with pitch accent.

The first gen Japanese tokenizer mainly relies on cutlet => fugashi => mecab => unidic-lite, with each being a wrapper around the next. Deep gratitute to [@Respaired](https://github.com/Respaired) for helping me learn the ropes of Japanese tokenization before any vansarah model had started training.

### Korean
The Korean tokenizer is copied from 5Hyeons's g2pkc fork of Kyubyong's widely used g2pK library. Deep gratitute to [@5Hyeons](https://github.com/5Hyeons) for kindly helping with Korean and extending the original code by [@Kyubyong](https://github.com/Kyubyong).

### Chinese
The second gen Chinese tokenizer adapts better logic from paddlespeech's frontend. Jieba now cuts and tags, and pinyin-to-ipa is no longer used.

The first gen Chinese tokenizer uses jieba to cut, pypinyin, and pinyin-to-ipa.

### TODO
- [ ] Data: Compress [data](https://github.com/mr-don88/quangdon/tree/main/quangdon/data) (no need for indented json) and eliminate redundancy between gold and silver dictionaries.
- [ ] Fallbacks: Train seq2seq fallback models on dictionaries using [this notebook](https://github.com/Kyubyong/nlp_made_easy/blob/master/PyTorch%20seq2seq%20template%20based%20on%20the%20g2p%20task.ipynb).
- [ ] Homographs: Escalate hard words like `axes bass bow lead tear wind` using BERT contextual word embeddings (CWEs) and logistic regression (LR) models (`nn.Linear` followed by sigmoid) as described in [this paper](https://assets.amazon.science/c3/db/23ca18d7450d8dbb5b80a11fcdd3/homograph-disambiguation-with-contextual-word-embeddings-for-tts-systems.pdf). Assuming `trf=True`, BERT CWEs can be accessed via `doc._.trf_data`, see [en.py#L479](https://github.com/mr-don88/quangdon/blob/main/quangdon/en.py#L479). Per-word LR models can be trained on [WikipediaHomographData](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/WikipediaHomographData), [llama-hd-dataset](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama-hd-dataset), and LLM-generated data.
- [x] More languages: Add `ko.py`, `ja.py`, `zh.py`.
- [x] Per-language pip installs

# Claude Optimization Layer

This directory contains Claude-specific metadata and optimization structures designed to enhance AI-assisted development.

## Directory Structure

- **metadata/**: Normalized codebase information and dependency graphs
- **code_index/**: Pre-analyzed semantic relationships
- **debug_history/**: Historical debugging sessions and solutions
- **patterns/**: Canonical implementation patterns
- **cheatsheets/**: Quick-reference guides for components
- **qa/**: Questions and answers database
- **delta/**: Version-to-version semantic change logs
- **anchors/**: Memory anchors for precise code reference
- **scratchpad/**: AI agent temporary working notes and thoughts

## Usage

This structure is designed to be used by Claude instances to:
1. Quickly understand codebase structure and relationships
2. Access historical debugging information
3. Reference established patterns and best practices
4. Navigate code using semantic anchors

## Maintenance

- Update metadata when adding new components
- Document debugging sessions in debug_history
- Add new patterns as they emerge
- Keep cheatsheets current with API changes

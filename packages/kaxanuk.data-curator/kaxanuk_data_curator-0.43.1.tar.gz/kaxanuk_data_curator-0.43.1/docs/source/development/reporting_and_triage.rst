Reporting Bugs and Requesting Enhancements
==========================================

- **Search Existing Issues First**
  Before opening a new issue, check whether someone has already reported the same bug or requested a similar feature.

- **Create a Clear Issue**
  If no existing issue covers your concern, open a new one. In the issue body, include:

  1. **Title**
     A concise summary (e.g., ``rolling_average: incorrect behavior when window > series length``).

  2. **Description**

     - What you observed versus what you expected.
     - Steps (or a minimal code snippet) to reproduce.
     - Version of Data Curator you’re using.

  3. **Labels**
     Tag as ``bug``, ``enhancement``, or ``documentation`` as appropriate.

- **Wait for Triage**
  A maintainer will review the issue, ask for clarification, or assign it.
  Only after the issue is acknowledged should you begin implementing code changes.

Finding Work to Do
------------------

- **Good First Issues**
  Look for issues labeled “good first issue”; these typically have a well-defined scope and minimal dependencies.

- **Assign Yourself**
  If an issue is unassigned, comment “I’d like to work on this” to reserve it.
  If it’s already taken, choose another.

<AboutData>

The ColliderML dataset is the largest-yet source of full-detail simulation in a virtual detector experiment.

**Why virtual?** The simulation choices are not tied to a construction timeline, there are no budget limitations, no politics. The only goals are to produce the most realistic physics on a detailed detector geometry, with significant computating challenges, in an ML-friendly structure.

Here is an example collision:

<div class="phoenix-container">
  <iframe 
    src="https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/phoenix/atlas"
    style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: none; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: var(--vp-shadow-2);"
    title="Phoenix Event Display"
    loading="lazy"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  ></iframe>
</div>

<style>
.phoenix-container {
  margin: 2rem 0;
}
</style>

All of the data in this visualisation is available to inspect, including mappings between objects and performance benchmarks of those reconstructed objects.

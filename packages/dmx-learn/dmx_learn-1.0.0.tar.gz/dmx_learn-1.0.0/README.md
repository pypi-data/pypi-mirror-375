```

## Stats Examples
Examples using `stats` distributions that run locally are located in ./dmx/examples/

```
> export PYHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path./to/dmx-learn
> PYTHONPATH=/path/to/package/ python ./dmx/examples/stats_examples/mixture_example.py
```

## Running with Spark
Examples that run with Apache Spark are located in./dmx/examples_spark/

First build a wheel
```
> cd /path/to/dmx-learn
> pip install setuptools wheel
> python setup.py bdist_wheel
```

```
> /path/to/spark/bin/spark-submit --master local[*] --py-files /path/to/package/dist/dmx-learn-0.1.8.4-py3-none-any.whl ./dmx/examples_spark/mixture_example.py
```

## Running with MPI4PY
Examples that run with mpi4py are located in ./dmx/mpi4py/examples/

Below will run the example ./dmx/mpi4py/examples/estimation_example.py with 4 cores.
```
> export PYHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path./to/dmx-learn
> mpiexec -n 4 python /path/to/package/dmx/mpi4py/examples/estimation_example.py

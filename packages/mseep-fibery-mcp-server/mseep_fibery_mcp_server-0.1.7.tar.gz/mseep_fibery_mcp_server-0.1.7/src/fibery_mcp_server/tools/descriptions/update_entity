Update Fibery entity with specified fields.
Examples (note, that these databases are non-existent, use databases only from user's schema!):
Query: Update a feature we talked about
Tool use:
{
    "database": "Product Management/Feature",
    "entity": {
        "fibery/id": "12345678-1234-5678-1234-567812345678",
        "Product Management/Name": "New Feature 2",
        "Product Management/Description": {"append": true, "content": "Notes: some notes"},
        "workflow/state": "In Progress"
    }
}
In case of successful execution, you will get a link to updated entity. Make sure to give that link to the user.

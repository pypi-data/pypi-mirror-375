**PYORPS** is an open-source tool designed to automate route planning for underground cables in power systems. It uses high-resolution raster geodata to perform least-cost path analyses, optimizing routes based on economic and environmental factors.

## Overview

Power line route planning is a complex and time-consuming process traditionally neglected in early grid planning. **PYORPS** addresses this by:

- Finding optimal routes between connection points using least-cost path analysis
- Supporting high-resolution raster data for precise planning
- Considering both economic costs and environmental constraints
- Allowing customization of neighborhood selection and search parameters
- Enabling easy integration into existing planning workflows

While tailored for distribution grids, it can be adapted for various infrastructures, optimizing routes for cost and environmental impact.

## Features

- **Flexible Input Data**: Use local raster files directly or create custom rasterized geodata from  WFS services or 
  local vector files
- **Customizable Costs**: Define terrain-specific cost values based on installation expenses or environmental impacts
- **Multiple Path Finding**: Calculate optimal routes between multiple sources and targets in parallel
- **Performance Optimization**: Control search space parameters to balance accuracy and computational efficiency
- **Environmental Consideration**: Add cost modifiers for nature reserves, water protection zones, and other sensitive 
  regions
- **GIS Integration**: Export results as GeoJSON for further analysis in GIS applications


## Quick Start

Here's a minimal example to get you started:

```python
from pyorps import PathFinder

# Define a file path to a raster file! 
raster_path = r"<PATH>\<TO>\<YOUR>\<RASTER_FILE>.tiff" 

# Define your source and target coordinates (must be in the same CRS)
source = (..., ...)
target = (..., ...)

# Create PathFinder instance
path_finder = PathFinder(
    dataset_source=raster_path,
    source_coords=source,
    target_coords=target,
)

# Find optimal route
path_finder.find_route()

# Visualize results
path_finder.plot_paths()

# Export to GeoJSON
path_finder.save_paths(r"<PATH>\<TO>\<YOUR>\<RESULTS>.geojson" )
```

Please check out the [example](https://github.com/marhofmann/pyorps/blob/master/examples/create_rasterized_geodata.ipynb)
for creating and setting up a dedicated raster dataset for your planning task.

## Installation

You can easily install **PYORPS** from the Python Package Index (PyPI) using pip or other 
package management tools.

#### Using pip

You can install the base package using pip:

```bash
pip install pyorps
```

This command will install the core functionality of **PYORPS** along with its essential dependencies, including:

- [NumPy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy)
- [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas)
- [GeoPandas](https://github.com/geopandas/geopandas)
- [Numba](https://github.com/numba/numba)
- [Rasterio](https://github.com/rasterio/rasterio)

#### Optional Dependencies

**PYORPS** offers several optional dependencies that enhance its functionality. You can install these extras by specifying them in square brackets:

- **Examples**: To include all dependencies for examples and case-studies:
  ```bash
  pip install pyorps[examples]
  ```

- **Case Studies**: To include case study scripts:
  ```bash
  pip install pyorps[case_studies]
  ```

- **Development and Testing**: To include testing tools and the tests directory:
  ```bash
  pip install pyorps[dev]
  ```

- **Full Installation**: To install all optional dependencies at once:
  ```bash
  pip install pyorps[full]
  ```


## How It Works

**PYORPS** performs route planning through these key steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: Categorizes continuous land use data using GeoPandas
2. **Rasterization**: Converts categorized geodata to raster format with cost values using Rasterio
3. **Graph Creation**: Transforms rasterized dataset into a graph structure using NetworKit
4. **Path Analysis**: Performs least-cost path analysis on the graph to find optimal routes
5. **Result Export**: Exports results in GeoJSON format for further use in GIS applications

The process can be configured with different neighborhood selections (R0-R3) and search space parameters to balance accuracy and performance.

## Use Cases

- **Distribution Grid Planning**: Optimize new underground cable connections to increase grid capacity
- **Grid Integration of Renewable Energies**: Determine optimal point of common coupling (PCC) and find the most 
  economical route for grid integration
- **Environmental Impact Reduction**: Route underground cables to minimize impact on protected areas
- **Cost Optimization**: Balance construction costs with environmental considerations and other aspects
- **General Infrastructure Planning**: Adapt for other linear infrastructure planning tasks (e.g. fiber optic cables or
  pipes)


## Technical Details

### Search Space Control: Buffering & Masking

Efficient path finding in large rasters requires limiting the search space. **PYORPS** provides:

- **Buffering**: Define a buffer (in meters) around the source/target line or polygon, restricting the raster window and graph to relevant areas. Buffer size can be set manually or estimated automatically based on terrain complexity.
- **Masking**: Apply geometric masks (e.g., polygons, convex hulls) to further restrict the area considered for 
  routing. Pixels outside the mask are not considered.

This dramatically reduces memory and computation time, especially for high-resolution data.

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>


### Neighborhoods: Fine-Grained Connectivity

The raster-to-graph conversion supports customizable neighborhood definitions:

- **Predefined and tested neighborhoods**:  
  - `R0` (4-connectivity), `R1` (8-connectivity), `R2` (16-connectivity), `R3`  (32-connectivity),
- **Custom neighborhoods**:  
  - Specify arbitrary step sets for advanced use cases or anisotropic cost surfaces.
- **High-order neighborhoods**:  
  - For `k > 3`, arbitrary neighborhoods are supported, enabling long-range or non-local connections.

This allows you to balance accuracy (following real-world paths) and performance (sparser graphs).

### Data Input: Raster & Vector, Local & Remote

**PYORPS** is agnostic to data source and format:

- **Raster data**:  
  - Directly use high-resolution GeoTIFFs or similar formats (tested up to 0.25 m² per pixel).
- **Vector data**:  
  - Shapefiles, GeoJSON, GPKG, or remote WFS layers (e.g., land registry, nature reserves, water protection zones).
- **Hybrid workflows**:  
  - Rasterize vector data with custom cost assumptions, overlay multiple datasets, and apply complex modifications.

All data is internally harmonized to a common CRS and resolution.

### Cost Assumptions: From Simple to Complex

Routing is driven by a **cost raster**. **PYORPS** supports:

- **Simple costs**:  
  - Assign a single cost per land use class or feature.
- **Hierarchical/multi-attribute costs**:  
  - Use CSV, Excel, or JSON files to define costs based on multiple attributes (e.g., land use + soil type).
- **Dynamic overlays**:  
  - Overlay additional datasets (e.g., protected areas) with additive or multiplicative cost modifiers, or set areas as forbidden.
- **Custom logic**:  
  - Apply buffers, ignore fields, or use complex rules for cost assignment.

**How to use:**  
- Use as a CSV file with columns (e.g. `land_use`, `category`, `cost`)  
- The `cost` value can be interpreted as €/m or as a relative score.
- Use uint16 and set 65535 to indicate forbidden areas.


### Rasterization: High-Resolution, Multi-Layer, and Overlay

- **High-resolution rasterization**:  
  - Rasterize vector data at arbitrary resolutions (tested up to 0.25 m² per pixel) using [Rasterio](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/).
- **Buffering and overlays**:  
  - Apply geometric buffers to features before rasterization.
  - Overlay multiple datasets, each with its own cost logic.
- **Selective masking**:  
  - Mask out fields or regions, set forbidden values, or combine multiple masks.

### Supported Data Types

- **Vector formats**: Shapefile, GeoJSON, GPKG, GML, KML, WFS (remote)
- **Raster formats**: GeoTIFF, IMG, JP2, BIL, DEM, in-memory numpy arrays
- **Data sources**: Land registry, nature reserves, water protection areas, custom user data


### Various Graph Backends & Path-Finding Algorithms

**PYORPS** supports multiple high-performance graph libraries as interchangeable backends for path finding:

- **Cython**: In PYORPS, specialized Cython implementations of path-finding algorithms 
 are integrated for efficient processing of raster data. This backend offers the 
 highest performance, as it operates directly on raster structures without requiring conversion to graph representations.
- **[NetworKit](https://networkit.github.io/)**: Fast C++/Python library for large-scale network analysis.
- **[Rustworkx](https://qiskit.org/documentation/rustworkx/)**: Pythonic, Rust-powered graph algorithms.
- **[NetworkX](https://networkx.org/)**: Widely-used, pure Python graph library.
- **[iGraph](https://igraph.org/python/)**: Efficient C-based graph library.
- **(Upcoming)**: GPU-accelerated backends (e.g., cuGraph, Dask-cuGraph).

You can select the backend via the `graph_api` parameter in `PathFinder`. Each backend exposes a unified interface for shortest path computation, supporting:

- **Δ-stepping**: Parallel path-finding algorithm - highest performance on multicore 
  CPUs
- **Dijkstra**: Robust and efficient.
- **A***: Heuristic-based, faster for spatial graphs with good heuristics.
- **Bellman-Ford**: Handles negative weights (where supported).
- **Bidirectional Dijkstra**: Available in some backends for further speedup.

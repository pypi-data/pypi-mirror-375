=============
 blocklister
=============

Command-line utility and Python library for converting blocklists between formats.

-------
 Usage

(TBD…)

 Contributing

TL;DR
-----

`Behave like a decent person`_,
`install pre-commit`_,
run ``pre-commit install`` in the project root, and
take heed of any errors you get when trying to commit.

.. _`install pre-commit`: https://pre-commit.com/#installation

General
-------

The project aims to follow best practices for development. Be sure to
`behave like a decent person`_ in all interactions related to this project.

We follow a number of standards and best-practices with the aim that
on-boarding of contributors, incl. our future selves, will go more smoothly.
This includes utilizing `pre-commit`_ to automate checking a bunch of things
before code even gets committed to the repository. It is *highly* recommended
that anyone wanting to contribute enables this.

Relevant standards for code style and commit messages are specified in those sections.

.. _pre-commit: https://pre-commit.com/

REUSE
~~~~~

The `REUSE Specification`_ aims to “make licensing easy for humans and
machines alike.” This is unlikely something you will need to worry about,
but in the case where you do wish to add code from elsewhere, be sure to keep
this in mind.

.. _REUSE Specification: https://reuse.software/

Code style
----------

This project generally aims to adhere to official Python project style guidelines, such as PEP8_.
More specifically, it uses `the Black code style`_ as implemented via `Ruff`_.

.. _PEP8: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
.. _the Black code style: https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html
.. _Ruff: https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/

Commit style
------------

`Keep commits atomic`_ and use `Conventional Commits`_ with `good commit messages`_.

.. _`Keep commits atomic`: https://www.freshconsulting.com/insights/blog/atomic-commits/
.. _`Conventional Commits`: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/

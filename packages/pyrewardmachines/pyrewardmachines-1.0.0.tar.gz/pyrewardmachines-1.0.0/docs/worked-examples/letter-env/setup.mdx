# Setting Up and Running Examples

This guide explains how to set up and run the PyCRM examples. Since the examples are not packaged with the source code, you'll need to clone the repository and set up the development environment.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10-3.12
- Git
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager (recommended)

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the PyCRM repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TristanBester/pycrm.git
cd pycrm
```

## Step 2: Set Up the Development Environment

PyCRM supports both `uv` (recommended for faster installation) and `pip` for dependency management. Choose the option that works best for your setup:

### Option A: Using uv (Recommended)

```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies with development extras
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Alternatively, you can use `uv sync` for faster installation:

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
```

### Option B: Using pip

```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies with development extras
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

**Note**: If you don't have `uv` installed, you can install it first:
```bash
pip install uv
```

## Step 3: Navigate to Examples Directory

Change to the examples directory:

```bash
cd examples
```

## Step 4: Understanding the Example Structure

The examples are organized into several categories:

### Introduction Examples (`introduction/`)
Basic examples demonstrating core concepts:
- `q_learning.py` - Q-learning in a letter world environment
- `cq_learning.py` - Counterfactual Q-learning
- `environment_example.py` - Basic environment setup
- `core/` - Core components (ground environment, labelling function, reward machine)

### CRM Examples (`crm/`)
Examples using Counting Reward Machines:
- **Continuous**: SAC, TD3, DDPG, and their CRM variants (CSAC, CTD3, CDDPG)
- **Discrete**: DQN and CDQN
- **Tabular**: Basic tabular implementations

### RM Examples (`rm/`)
Examples using standard Reward Machines:
- **Continuous**: SAC, TD3, DDPG
- **Discrete**: DQN
- **Tabular**: Basic tabular implementations

## Step 5: Running Examples

### Basic Examples

Run the introduction examples directly:

```bash
cd introduction

# Run Q-learning example
python q_learning.py

# Run counterfactual Q-learning
python cq_learning.py

# Run environment example
python environment_example.py
```

### Advanced Examples

For the CRM and RM examples, run from their respective directories:

```bash
# CRM continuous examples
cd crm/continuous
python sac.py --seed 42

# CRM discrete examples
cd crm/discrete
python dqn.py --seed 42

# RM continuous examples
cd rm/continuous
python sac.py --seed 42

# RM discrete examples
cd rm/discrete
python dqn.py --seed 42
```

Most examples accept command-line arguments:

```bash
# Run with specific seed for reproducibility
python sac.py --seed 123

# Run multiple experiments (if supported)
python sac.py --seeds 1 2 3 4 5
```

## Step 6: Experiment Tracking

Many examples integrate with Weights & Biases (wandb) for experiment tracking:

```bash
# Log in to wandb (first time only)
wandb login

# Run example with wandb tracking
python sac.py --seed 42
```

You can view your experiments at [wandb.ai](https://wandb.ai).

## Step 7: Using SLURM (HPC Systems)

For high-performance computing environments, PyCRM provides SLURM scripts located in the `scripts/` directory. These scripts are organized by example type and algorithm:

### SLURM Script Organization

The SLURM scripts are located in `scripts/examples/` and organized as follows:
- `scripts/examples/crm/` - Scripts for Counting Reward Machine examples
- `scripts/examples/rm/` - Scripts for standard Reward Machine examples

Each category contains:
- `continuous/` - Scripts for continuous control algorithms (SAC, TD3, DDPG, etc.)
- `discrete/` - Scripts for discrete control algorithms (DQN, etc.)

### Running SLURM Scripts

```bash
# Navigate to the appropriate scripts directory
cd scripts/examples/crm/continuous

# Run all algorithms in the category
./start.sh

# Or run individual algorithms
sbatch sac.slurm
sbatch td3.slurm
sbatch ddpg.slurm

# For discrete algorithms
cd scripts/examples/crm/discrete
sbatch dqn.slurm
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**: Ensure you're running from the correct directory:
   ```bash
   cd examples/crm/continuous  # Not just cd examples
   ```

2. **Dependency Issues**: Make sure all dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
   uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

3. **Python Version**: Ensure you're using Python 3.10-3.12:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

4. **Virtual Environment**: Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

## Next Steps

After running the examples:
- Check the [Worked Examples](/worked-examples/letter-env/ground-environment) for detailed tutorials
- Explore the [Core Concepts](/core-concepts/labelling-functions) documentation
- Try modifying the examples to experiment with different parameters

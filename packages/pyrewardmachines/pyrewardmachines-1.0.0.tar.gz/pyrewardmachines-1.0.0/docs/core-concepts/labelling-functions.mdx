# Labelling Functions

<Info>
  Labelling functions bridge the gap between low-level environment observations and high-level symbolic events that RM/CRMs understand.
</Info>

## Overview

In the RM/CRM framework, labelling functions play a critical role in abstracting raw environment observations into meaningful symbolic events. These events form the vocabulary that the RM/CRM uses to define rewards and transitions.

## Core Concept

A labelling function maps an environment transition (observation, action, next observation) to a set of symbolic events (a truth assignment for a set of propositions). This abstraction layer provides several benefits:

- **Modularity**: Separate environment dynamics from task specification
- **Reusability**: Same environment can support different tasks by changing the labelling
- **Expressiveness**: Define complex tasks in terms of abstract events rather than raw states

## Implementation

### Base Class

The RM/CRM framework provides a base `LabellingFunction` class that handles the core functionality:

```python
from abc import ABC
from enum import Enum
from typing import Any, Generic, TypeVar

ObsType = TypeVar("ObsType")  # Type of observations
ActType = TypeVar("ActType")  # Type of actions

class LabellingFunction(ABC, Generic[ObsType, ActType]):
    """Base class for labelling functions."""
    
    @staticmethod
    def event(func):
        """Decorator to register an event detection method."""
        setattr(func, "_is_event_method", True)
        return func
        
    def __call__(self, obs: ObsType, action: ActType, next_obs: ObsType) -> set[Enum]:
        """Detect all events in a transition."""
        # Implementation details...
```

The base class provides:
1. Type parameters for observation and action types
2. An `event` decorator to identify event detection methods
3. A `__call__` method that runs all event detectors on a transition

### Creating a Labelling Function

To create a custom labelling function, follow these steps:

1. **Define your events as an Enum**:
   ```python
   class Symbol(Enum):
       A = auto()
       B = auto()
       C = auto()
   ```

2. **Create a subclass of `LabellingFunction`**:
   ```python
   class MyLabellingFunction(LabellingFunction[MyObsType, MyActType]):
       # Implementation...
   ```

3. **Implement event detection methods with the `@event` decorator**:
   ```python
   @LabellingFunction.event
   def detect_event_x(self, obs, action, next_obs) -> Symbol | None:
       # Logic to detect event X
       if condition_met:
           return Symbol.X
       return None
   ```

Each event method should:
- Accept the parameters `(self, obs, action, next_obs)`
- Return an Enum value when the event is detected
- Return `None` when the event is not detected

### How It Works

When you call a labelling function with `lf(obs, action, next_obs)`, it:

1. Looks for all methods decorated with `@LabellingFunction.event`
2. Calls each method with the provided transition
3. Collects all non-None results into a set
4. Returns this set of detected events

## Example: Letter World

Let's examine a complete example from the Letter World environment:

```python
from enum import Enum, auto
import numpy as np
from pycrm.label import LabellingFunction

class Symbol(Enum):
    """Symbols in the Letter World environment."""
    A = auto()
    B = auto()
    C = auto()

class LetterWorldLabellingFunction(LabellingFunction[np.ndarray, int]):
    """Labelling function for the Letter World environment."""

    A_B_POSITION = np.array([1, 1])
    C_POSITION = np.array([1, 5])

    @LabellingFunction.event
    def test_symbol_a(
        self, obs: np.ndarray, action: np.ndarray, next_obs: np.ndarray
    ) -> Symbol | None:
        """Return if the agent observes symbol A."""
        if next_obs[0] == 0 and np.array_equal(next_obs[1:], self.A_B_POSITION):
            return Symbol.A
        return None

    @LabellingFunction.event
    def test_symbol_b(
        self, obs: np.ndarray, action: np.ndarray, next_obs: np.ndarray
    ) -> Symbol | None:
        """Return if the agent observes symbol B."""
        if next_obs[0] == 1 and np.array_equal(next_obs[1:], self.A_B_POSITION):
            return Symbol.B
        return None

    @LabellingFunction.event
    def test_symbol_c(
        self, obs: np.ndarray, action: np.ndarray, next_obs: np.ndarray
    ) -> Symbol | None:
        """Return if the agent observes symbol C."""
        if next_obs[0] == 1 and np.array_equal(next_obs[1:], self.C_POSITION):
            return Symbol.C
        return None
```

This example:
1. Defines three symbols (A, B, C) as events
2. Creates a labelling function that works with numpy array observations and integer actions
3. Implements three event detection methods, each checking specific conditions
4. Returns the appropriate symbol when conditions are met

## Using Labelling Functions

Once defined, you use a labelling function as part of a cross-product environment:

```python
# Create components
ground_env = LetterWorld()
lf = LetterWorldLabellingFunction()
crm = LetterWorldCountingRewardMachine()

# Create cross-product environment
env = LetterWorldCrossProduct(
    ground_env=ground_env,
    crm=crm,
    lf=lf,
    max_steps=500,
)

# When env.step() is called, the labelling function
# automatically converts observations to events
next_obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)
detected_events = info.get('events', [])  # Events detected in this step
```

## Best Practices

When creating labelling functions:

1. **Keep events meaningful**: Define events that have semantic meaning for your task
2. **Be consistent**: Ensure event detection is consistent and deterministic
3. **Handle edge cases**: Consider all possible transitions and what they should mean
4. **Document conditions**: Clearly document when each event is triggered
5. **Use clear naming**: Name your event detection methods descriptively

## Summary

Labelling functions are a powerful abstraction mechanism in the RM/CRM framework. They:

- Convert low-level observations to high-level events
- Allow for modular task specification
- Enable the same environment to support different tasks
- Provide a clean separation between environment dynamics and reward logic

By properly designing your labelling function, you can create complex tasks that would be difficult to specify using traditional reward functions.

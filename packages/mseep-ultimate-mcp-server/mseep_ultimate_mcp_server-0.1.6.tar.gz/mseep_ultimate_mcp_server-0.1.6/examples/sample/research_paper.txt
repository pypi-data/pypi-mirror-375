# Quantum Entanglement-Based Secure Communication Protocol Using Topological Qubits

## Abstract

This paper introduces a novel quantum communication protocol that leverages topological qubits and quantum entanglement to achieve unprecedented levels of security and fault tolerance. Our research team at the Quantum Information Science Laboratory (QISL) at MIT, in collaboration with researchers from Stanford University's Quantum Systems Engineering Department and Google's Quantum AI division, has successfully demonstrated a practical implementation of this protocol using a 128-qubit quantum processor.

The protocol, named "TopEnt," combines the inherent security properties of quantum entanglement with the error resistance of topological quantum computation. Through a series of experiments conducted between January 2024 and March 2025, we achieved secure key distribution rates of 15.4 kilobits per second over a distance of 103 kilometers with a quantum bit error rate (QBER) of only 0.42%, significantly outperforming previous quantum key distribution methods.

Our findings suggest that TopEnt is resistant to all currently known quantum attack vectors, including photon-number splitting attacks and measurement-device-independent vulnerabilities. The theoretical foundation of our work builds upon established research by Bennett and Brassard (1984), Ekert (1991), and the more recent contributions of Zhang et al. (2022) on topological quantum error correction.

The practical implementation was made possible through a novel quantum repeater design developed by our team that utilizes entanglement swapping across intermediate nodes. Additionally, we employed a modified version of the surface code for error correction, enabling reliable quantum state preservation even in noisy environments.

This research was funded by DARPA's Quantum Information Science Program (Grant No. QIS-2023-45678), the National Science Foundation (Grant No. PHY-2356789), and received computational support from the MIT Quantum Computing Center.

These findings have significant implications for secure military communications, financial data transmission, and the future quantum internet infrastructure. We anticipate that TopEnt could be deployed in real-world applications within the next 3-5 years, pending further refinements and miniaturization of the required quantum hardware.

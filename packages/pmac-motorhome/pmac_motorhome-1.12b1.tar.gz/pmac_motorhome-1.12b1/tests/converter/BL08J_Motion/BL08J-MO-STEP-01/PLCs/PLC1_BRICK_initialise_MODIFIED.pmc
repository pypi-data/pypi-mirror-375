; PLC for putting Geobrick into defined state at startup
; Original Author: Tom Cobb
; Used variables: None, (P101..P132 reserved for CS mres)
; Macros (and values): 
; PLC2 = ENABLE ; Enable or disable PLC2
; ...
; PLC31 = DISABLE ; Enable or disable PLC31
; This PLC will make sure a brick is in a known state at startup by running 
; PLC6, defining some lookahead buffers, and enabling/disabling PLCs. After
; first run, it will just define the buffers and enable/disable PLCs
;
; NB Needs BRICK_M_variables.pmc loaded

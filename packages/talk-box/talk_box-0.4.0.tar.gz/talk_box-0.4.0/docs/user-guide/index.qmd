Talk Box is a comprehensive Python framework for building and deploying attention-optimized conversational AI chatbots. Whether you're building customer support bots, technical advisors, or creative writing assistants, Talk Box provides the tools you need to create intelligent, context-aware chatbots with minimal code.

## Why Talk Box?

**Attention-Optimized Prompts**: built on modern prompt engineering research, Talk Box uses attention patterns and cognitive principles to create more effective prompts that improve AI response quality.

**Simple but Powerful**: start with a single line of code, then scale to complex multi-turn conversations with advanced prompt engineering techniques.

**Fluent API**: chainable configuration methods make it easy to build exactly the chatbot you need without boilerplate code.

**Conversation Management**: automatic message history, context windows, and conversation state management so you can focus on your application logic.

## Quick Start

Get up and running in just a few lines:

```python
import talk_box as tb

# Create and configure a chatbot
bot = (
    tb.ChatBot()
    .model("gpt-4-turbo")
    .preset("technical_advisor")
    .temperature(0.3)
)

# Start chatting
conversation = bot.chat("How do I optimize Python code for performance?")
print(conversation.get_last_message().content)
```

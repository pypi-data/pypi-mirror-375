    """Grader for evaluating the grid non-uniformity of a Data Matrix code.

    Grid non-uniformity measures the deviation of the grid intersections
    from their ideal position. Lower grid non-uniformity values indicate more
    consistent and accurate grid positioning, which improves readability and
    scanning reliability.

    The grid non-uniformity grade is determined by the following thresholds:
    - Grade A: Less than or equal to 0.38
    - Grade B: 0.39 to 0.50
    - Grade C: 0.51 to 0.63
    - Grade D: 0.64 to 0.75

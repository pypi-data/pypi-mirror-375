# ZeroPath MCP Server

Interact with your product security findings using natural language.

This open-source MCP server allows developers to query SAST issues, secrets, patches, and more from ZeroPath directly inside AI-assisted tools like Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, and other MCP-compatible environments.

No dashboards. No manual ticket triage. Just security context where you're already working.

## Installation

### 1. Generate API Key

Generate an API key from your ZeroPath organization settings at [https://zeropath.com/app/settings/api](https://zeropath.com/app/settings/api)

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Set up your environment variables with the API key:

```bash
export ZEROPATH_TOKEN_ID=your_token_id
export ZEROPATH_TOKEN_SECRET=your_token_secret
```

### 3. Retrieve Your Organization ID

Run the following command to get your organization ID:

```bash
curl -X POST https://zeropath.com/api/v1/orgs/list \
    -H "X-ZeroPath-API-Token-Id: $ZEROPATH_TOKEN_ID" \
    -H "X-ZeroPath-API-Token-Secret: $ZEROPATH_TOKEN_SECRET" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{}'
```

### 4. Install [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

We use `uv` for dependency management:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### 5. Clone and Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZeroPathAI/zeropath-mcp-server.git
cd zeropath-mcp-server
uv sync
export ZEROPATH_ORG_ID=your_org_id
```

---

## Configuration

Add this entry to your MCP config (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "zeropath-mcp-server": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--project",
        "<absolute cloned directory path>/zeropath-mcp-server",
        "<absolute cloned directory path>/zeropath-mcp-server/main.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `<absolute cloned directory path>` with the absolute path to the repo.

## Environment Variables

Before running the server, export the following:

```bash
export ZEROPATH_TOKEN_ID=your_token_id
export ZEROPATH_TOKEN_SECRET=your_token_secret
export ZEROPATH_ORG_ID=your_org_id
```

These can be generated from your ZeroPath dashboard.

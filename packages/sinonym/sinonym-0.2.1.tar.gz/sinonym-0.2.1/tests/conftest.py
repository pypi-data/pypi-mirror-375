"""
Pytest configuration and fixtures for sinonym test suite.

This module provides shared fixtures to optimize test performance by avoiding
repeated expensive initialization of ChineseNameDetector instances.

Also supports injecting candidate weight vectors via the optional
environment variable `SINONYM_WEIGHTS` (JSON-encoded list of 8 floats), to
enable automated optimization scripts to evaluate weight configurations.

    Session-scoped ChineseNameDetector instance shared across all tests.
    
    This fixture creates a single detector instance that is reused for the entire

    be repeated for each test file.
    
    The detector is stateless after initialization, so sharing it across tests
    does not affect test isolation.

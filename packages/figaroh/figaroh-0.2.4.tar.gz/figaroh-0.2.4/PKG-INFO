### Configuration

FIGAROH now supports a modern unified configuration system with enhanced flexibility and compatibility:

#### Unified Configuration Format

Modern YAML configuration with template inheritance and validation:

```yaml
# modern_config.yaml
inherit_from: "templates/base_robot.yaml"

robot:
  name: "tiago"
  urdf_path: "urdf/tiago.urdf"

calibration:
  method: "full_params"
  sensor_type: "camera"
  optimization:
    algorithm: "least_squares"
    tolerance: 1e-6
  
  markers:
    - ref_joint: "wrist_3_joint"  
      position: [0.1, 0.0, 0.05]
      measure: [true, true, true, true, true, true]

identification:
  mechanics:
    friction_coefficients:
      viscous: [0.01, 0.02, 0.015]
      static: [0.001, 0.002, 0.0015]
    actuator_inertias: [0.1, 0.15, 0.12]
    
  signal_processing:
    sampling_frequency: 5000.0
    cutoff_frequency: 100.0
    filter_type: "butterworth"
    filter_order: 5
```

#### Legacy Format Support

The system maintains full backward compatibility with existing configurations:

```yaml
# legacy_config.yaml  
calibration:
  calib_level: full_params
  base_frame: universe
  tool_frame: wrist_3_link
  markers:
    - ref_joint: wrist_3_joint
      measure: [True, True, True, True, True, True]

identification:
  robot_params:
    - q_lim_def: 1.57
      fv: [0.01, 0.02, 0.015] 
      fs: [0.001, 0.002, 0.0015]
  processing_params:
    - ts: 0.0002
      cut_off_frequency_butterworth: 100.0
```

#### Configuration Features

- **Automatic Format Detection**: System detects and handles both formats seamlessly
- **Template Inheritance**: Reuse common configurations across projects  
- **Parameter Mapping**: Advanced conversion between unified and legacy formats
- **Validation**: Comprehensive validation with helpful error messages
- **Documentation**: Built-in configuration documentation and examples
+ Step 2: Generate sampled exciting postures and trajectories for experimentation.
    - For geometric calibration: Firstly, considering the infinite possibilities of combination of postures can be generated, a finite pool of feasible sampled postures in working space for the considered system needs to be provided thanks to simulator. Then, the pool can be input for a script `optimal_config.py` with a combinatorial optimization algorithm which will calculate and propose an optimal set of calibration postures chosen from the pool with much less number of postures while maximizing the excitation.
    - For dynamic identification: A nonlinear optimization problem needs to formulated and solved thanks to Ipopt solver in a script named `optimal_trajectory.py`. Cost function can be chosen amongst different criteria such as condition number. Joint constraints, self-collision constraints should be obligatory, and other dedicated constraints can be included in constraint functions. Then, the Ipopt solver will iterate and find the best cubic spline that satisfies all constraints and optimize the defined cost function which aims to maximize the excitation for dynamics of the considered system.
+ Step 3: Collect and prepare data in the correct format.  
    To standardize the handling of data, we propose a sample format for collected data in CSV format. These datasets should be stored in a `data` folder for such considered system.
+ Step 4: Create a script implementing identification/calibration algorithms with templates.  
    Dedicated template scripts `calibration.py` and `identification.py` are provided. Users need to fill in essential parts to adapt to their systems. At the end, calibration/identification results will be displayed with visualization and statistical analysis. Then, it is up to users to justify the quality of calibration/identification based on their needs.
+ Step 5: Update model with identified parameters.  
    Once the results are accepted, users can update calibrated/identified parameters to their URDF model by scripts `update_model.py` or simply save to a `xacro` file for later usage.

## API Usage

### Modern Object-Oriented Interface

```python
import figaroh
from figaroh.calibration import BaseCalibration
from figaroh.identification import BaseIdentification  
from figaroh.tools.regressor import RegressorBuilder, RegressorConfig
from figaroh.utils.config_parser import UnifiedConfigParser

# Load robot model
robot = figaroh.tools.robot.load_robot("path/to/robot.urdf")

# Modern configuration parsing
parser = UnifiedConfigParser("config/robot_config.yaml")
config = parser.parse()

# Calibration workflow
calibration = BaseCalibration(robot, "config/robot_config.yaml")
calibration.load_data("data/calibration_data.csv")
results = calibration.run_calibration()

# Identification workflow  
identification = BaseIdentification(robot, "config/robot_config.yaml")
identification.load_data("data/identification_data.csv")
params = identification.run_identification()

# Advanced regressor building
regressor_config = RegressorConfig(
    has_friction=True,
    has_actuator_inertia=True,
    is_joint_torques=True
)
builder = RegressorBuilder(robot, regressor_config)
W = builder.build_basic_regressor(q, dq, ddq)
```

### Legacy Function Interface

```python
# Legacy function-based interface (still supported)
from figaroh.calibration import calibration_tools
from figaroh.identification import identification_tools

# Load parameters from YAML
calib_config = calibration_tools.get_param_from_yaml(robot, config_data)
identif_config = identification_tools.get_param_from_yaml(robot, config_data)

# Build regressors
from figaroh.tools.regressor import build_regressor_basic
W = build_regressor_basic(robot, q, dq, ddq, identif_config)
```

### Configuration Format Conversion

```python
from figaroh.calibration.calibration_tools import unified_to_legacy_config
from figaroh.identification.identification_tools import unified_to_legacy_identif_config

# Convert unified format to legacy format
unified_config = parser.create_task_config(robot, parsed_config, "calibration")  
legacy_config = unified_to_legacy_config(robot, unified_config)

# Automatic format detection and conversion in base classes
calibration = BaseCalibration(robot, "any_config_format.yaml")  # Works with both formats
```

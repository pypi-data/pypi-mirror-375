            TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
         
            1. Definitions.
         
               "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
               and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
         
               "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
               the copyright owner that is granting the License.
         
               "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
               other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
               control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
               "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
               direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
               otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
               outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

               "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
               including but not limited to software source code, documentation
               source, and configuration files.
         
               "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
               transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
               not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
               and conversions to other media types.
         
               "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
               Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
               copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
               (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
         
               "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
               form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
               editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
               represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
               of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
               separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
               the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
         
               "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
               the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
               to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
               submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
               or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
               the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
               means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
               to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
               communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
               and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
               Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
               excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
               designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
         
               "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
               on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
               subsequently incorporated within the Work.
         
            2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
               this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
               worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
               copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
               publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
               Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
         
            3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
               this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
               worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
               (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
               use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
               where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
               by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
               Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
               with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
               institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
               cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
               or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
               or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
               granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
               as of the date such litigation is filed.
         
            4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
               Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
               modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
               meet the following conditions:
         
               (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                   Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
         
               (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                   stating that You changed the files; and
         
               (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                   that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                   attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                   excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                   the Derivative Works; and
         
               (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                   distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                   include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                   within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                   pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                   of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                   as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                   documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                   within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                   wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                   of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                   do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                   notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                   or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                   that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                   as modifying the License.
         
               You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
               may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
               for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
               for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
               reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
               the conditions stated in this License.
         
            5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
               any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
               by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
               this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
               Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
               the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
               with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
         
            6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
               names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
               except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
               origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
         
            7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
               agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
               Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
               WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
               implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
               of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
               PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
               appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
               risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
         
            8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
               whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
               unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
               negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
               liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
               incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
               result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
               Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
               work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
               other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
               has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
         
            9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
               the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
               and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
               or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
               License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
               on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
               of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
               defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
               incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
               of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
         
            END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
         
            APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
         
               To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
               boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
               replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
               the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
               comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
               file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
               same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
               identification within third-party archives.

`xyzstyle` 是一款精心设计的基于 [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) 的文档主题，旨在提供美观、专业且易于使用的文档展示解决方案。该主题基于 `sphinx-book-theme` 进行定制，注重用户体验和视觉设计，同时保持了良好的可访问性和可定制性。

## 主题特点

- **现代化界面设计**：简洁清晰的布局，专业的配色方案
- **完善的响应式支持**：适配各种设备屏幕尺寸
- **丰富的内容展示**：支持Markdown、Jupyter笔记本等多种内容格式
- **国际化支持**：内置多语言翻译机制
- **易于定制**：提供多种配置选项满足不同需求

## 安装并激活主题

### 安装步骤

使用 Python 的包管理工具 `pip` 安装 `xyzstyle`：

```shell
pip install xyzstyle
```

如需安装特定版本，可以使用：

```shell
pip install xyzstyle==版本号
```

#### 开发模式安装（可编辑模式）

如果您需要对主题进行开发或修改，可以使用可编辑模式安装：

```shell
# 首先进入项目根目录
cd xyzstyle项目路径
# 然后以可编辑模式安装
pip install -ve .
```

其中参数含义：
- `-v` 表示详细输出
- `-e` 表示可编辑模式（开发模式）
- `.` 表示当前目录

这种安装方式会在安装包时创建一个指向源代码的链接，使您对源码的修改能够立即反映到已安装的包中，无需重新安装。

### 激活主题

安装完成后，需要在您的 Sphinx 项目配置文件（通常为 `conf.py` ）中进行设置以激活主题：

```python
# == 项目基本信息 ========================================================================
project = 'xyzstyle' # 项目名称
copyright = '2022, xinetzone' # 版权信息
author = 'xinetzone' # 作者信息

# == 主题设置 ============================================================================
html_theme = "xyzstyle" # 使用的HTML主题
# 静态资源配置
html_static_path = ['_static']  # 指定静态文件目录，用于存放CSS、JavaScript、图片等
html_logo = "_static/images/logo.jpg"  # 网站Logo路径，显示在页面顶部
html_favicon = "_static/images/favicon.jpg"  # 网站图标路径，显示在浏览器标签页
html_last_updated_fmt = '%Y-%m-%d, %H:%M:%S'  # 最后更新时间格式

# == 国际化与本地化设置 ==================================================================
language = 'zh_CN' # 文档语言（中文简体）
locale_dirs = ['../locales/'] # 翻译文件存放目录
gettext_compact = False # 是否合并子目录的PO文件（False表示不合并）

# == 扩展插件配置 ========================================================================
extensions = [
    "myst_nb",  # Markdown和Jupyter笔记本支持
] # 启用的Sphinx扩展
```

通过设置 `html_theme = "xyzstyle"` 即可在您的项目中激活 `xyzstyle` 主题，使生成的文档采用该主题的样式和布局。

### 其他选项

    "sphinx_comments",              # 添加评论和注释功能
])
# =============================================================================
# 可选功能配置
# =============================================================================
# 1. 代码复制按钮配置
copybutton_exclude = '.linenos, .gp'  # 排除行号和提示符
# 选择器配置，避免复制按钮出现在笔记本单元格编号上
copybutton_selector = ":not(.prompt) > div.highlight pre"

# 2. 评论系统配置
comments_config = {
   "hypothesis": True,  # 启用 Hypothesis 注释
   "utterances": {
      "repo": "xinetzone/xyzstyle",
      "optional": "config",
   }  # 启用 Utterances 评论
}
```

可以添加自定义图标链接，例如社交媒体图标、GitHub徽章或项目标志：

```python
# 在conf.py文件的开头添加
from utils.links import icon_links  # 或者直接定义

# 自定义图标链接
html_theme_options.update({
    "icon_links": [
        {
            "name": "GitHub",
            "url": "https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject",
            "icon": "fab fa-github",
            "type": "fontawesome",
        },
        {
            "name": "Twitter",
            "url": "https://twitter.com/yourusername",
            "icon": "fab fa-twitter",
            "type": "fontawesome",
        },
        # 更多图标链接...
    ],
})
```

    },
})

# Thebe 配置
thebe_config = {
    "repository_url": "https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject",
    "repository_branch": "main",
    "selector": "div.highlight",
}
```

#### 自定义样式

可以通过添加自定义CSS文件来覆盖默认样式：

```python
# 添加自定义CSS文件
html_static_path = ['_static']
html_css_files = ["css/custom.css"]
```

然后在 `_static/css/custom.css` 文件中添加自定义样式：

```css
/* 自定义公告横幅样式 */
.announcement {
    background-color: #4078c0;
    color: white;
    padding: 10px 0;
    text-align: center;
}

/* 自定义代码块样式 */
div.highlight {
    border-radius: 5px;
}

/* 更多自定义样式... */
```

### 下一步

配置完成后，您可以使用标准的 Sphinx 命令生成文档：

```shell
# 基本文档生成命令
sphinx-build -b html 源目录 输出目录

# 例如
sphinx-build -b html doc/source doc/build/html
```

生成的文档将使用 `xyzstyle` 主题的样式呈现，为您的项目提供专业、美观的文档界面。

## 项目目录结构

```
xyzstyle/
├── src/                  # 源代码目录
│   └── xyzstyle/         # 主题源码
│       ├── __init__.py   # 主题初始化文件
│       └── theme/        # 主题模板和样式
│           └── xyzstyle/ # 主题文件
├── doc/                  # 文档目录
│   ├── conf.py           # Sphinx配置文件
│   └── ...               # 其他文档源文件
├── pyproject.toml        # 项目配置和依赖
├── LICENSE               # 许可证文件
└── README.md             # 项目说明文档
```

# `sxs.cite`

For reasons of reproducibility — and for general academic integrity —
it is important to cite the specific packages and data you use in your
research.  In particular, it is absolutely vital to cite the specific
version of the catalog of SXS simulations you use, as well as the
version of this `sxs` package that you use.  The `sxs.cite` function
provides those specific citations.

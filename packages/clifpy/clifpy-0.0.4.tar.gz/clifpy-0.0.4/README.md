- All 9 [CLIF-2.0.0](https://clif-consortium.github.io/website/data-dictionary/data-dictionary-2.0.0.html) beta table implementations (patient, vitals, labs, etc.)
- Data validation against mCIDE schemas
- Timezone handling and conversion
- Advanced filtering and querying capabilities
- Comprehensive test suite
- CLIF Demo Dataset created using [MIMIC-IV Clinical Database Demo](https://physionet.org/content/mimic-iv-demo/2.2/)
- Example notebooks demonstrating usage

### üîÑ In Progress
- Package distribution setup (PyPI)
- Additional clinical calculation functions
- Performance optimizations for large datasets
- Enhanced documentation
- Integration with additional data sources

### üìã Planned Features
- SOFA score calculations
- Additional clinical severity scores
- Data visualization utilities
- Export functionality to other formats

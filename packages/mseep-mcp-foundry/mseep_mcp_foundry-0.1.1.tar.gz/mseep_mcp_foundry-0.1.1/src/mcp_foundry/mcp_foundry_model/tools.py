    """
    Retrieves a list of supported models from the Azure AI Foundry catalog.

    This function is useful when a user requests a list of available Foundry models or Foundry Labs projects.
    It fetches models based on optional filters like whether the model supports free playground usage,
    the publisher name, and the license type. The function will return the list of models with useful fields.

    Parameters:
        ctx (Context): The context of the current session. Contains metadata about the request and session.
        search_for_free_playground (bool, optional): If `True`, filters models to include only those that
            can be used for free by users for prototyping. If `False`, all models will be included regardless of free playground support.
            Defaults to `False`.
        publisher_name (str, optional): A filter to specify the publisher of the models to retrieve. If provided,
            only models from this publisher will be returned. Defaults to an empty string, meaning no filter is applied.
        license_name (str, optional): A filter to specify the license type of the models to retrieve. If provided,
            only models with this license will be returned. Defaults to an empty string, meaning no filter is applied.

    Returns:
        str: A JSON-encoded string containing the list of models and their metadata. The list will include 
             model names, inference model names, summaries, and the total count of models retrieved.

    Usage:
        Use this function when users inquire about available models from the Azure AI Foundry catalog.
        It can also be used when filtering models by free playground usage, publisher name, or license type.
        If user didn't specify free playground or ask for models that support GitHub token, always explain that by default it will show the all the models but some of them would support free playground.
        Explain to the user that if they want to find models suitable for prototyping and free to use with support for free playground, they can look for models that supports free playground, or look for models that they can use with GitHub token.

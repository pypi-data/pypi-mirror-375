    Processes Forest Light Environmental Simulator (FLiES) calculations using an 
    artificial neural network (ANN) emulator.

    This function takes various atmospheric and environmental parameters as input,
    including day of year, albedo, cloud optical thickness (COT), aerosol optical 
    thickness (AOT), water vapor, ozone, elevation, solar zenith angle (SZA), and 
    Köppen-Geiger climate classification. It uses these inputs to estimate radiative 
    transfer components such as total transmittance, diffuse and direct radiation 
    in different spectral bands (UV, visible, near-infrared).

    Args:
        doy: Day of year (Raster or np.ndarray).
        albedo: Surface albedo (Raster or np.ndarray).
        COT: Cloud optical thickness (Raster or np.ndarray).
        AOT: Aerosol optical thickness (Raster or np.ndarray).
        vapor_gccm: Water vapor in grams per square centimeter (Raster or np.ndarray).
        ozone_cm: Ozone concentration in centimeters (Raster or np.ndarray).
        elevation_km: Elevation in kilometers (Raster or np.ndarray).
        SZA: Solar zenith angle (Raster or np.ndarray).
        KG_climate: Köppen-Geiger climate classification (Raster or np.ndarray).
        geometry: RasterGeometry object defining the spatial extent and resolution.
        GEOS5FP_connection: GEOS5FP object for accessing GEOS-5 FP data.
        GEOS5FP_directory: Directory containing GEOS-5 FP data files.
        ANN_model: Pre-loaded ANN model object. If None, it's loaded from the file.
        model_filename: Filename of the ANN model to load.
        split_atypes_ctypes: Boolean flag for handling aerosol and cloud types.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing the calculated radiative transfer components 
              as Raster objects or np.ndarrays, including:
              - Ra: Extraterrestrial solar radiation.
              - Rg: Global solar radiation.
              - UV: Ultraviolet radiation.
              - VIS: Visible radiation.
              - NIR: Near-infrared radiation.
              - VISdiff: Diffuse visible radiation.
              - NIRdiff: Diffuse near-infrared radiation.
              - VISdir: Direct visible radiation.
              - NIRdir: Direct near-infrared radiation.
              - tm: Total transmittance.
              - puv: Proportion of UV radiation.
              - pvis: Proportion of visible radiation.
              - pnir: Proportion of NIR radiation.
              - fduv: Diffuse fraction of UV radiation.

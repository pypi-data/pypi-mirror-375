# Example Filesystem Configuration
# Add this section to your main configuration file to enable the filesystem tools

# Main filesystem configuration
filesystem:
  # List of allowed directories (absolute or with ~ for home directory)
  # All filesystem operations will be limited to these directories for security
  allowed_directories:
    - ~/data                     # User's data directory
    - /tmp/ultimate           # Temporary directory
    - /opt/ultimate/shared    # Shared application directory
  
  # Additional filesystem-specific options can be added here
  # For example, you could add settings like:
  # max_file_size: 10485760      # Maximum allowed file size (10MB)
  # enable_binary_files: false   # Whether to allow binary file operations
  # default_encoding: "utf-8"    # Default file encoding

# For development/debugging
logging:
  level: INFO
  log_colors: true
  log_file: logs/filesystem.log
  
# Integration with other parts of the system
mcp:
  tools:
    # Whether filesystem tools are enabled at all
    enable_filesystem: true
    # More granular permissions could be added here
    # For example, you could control which operations are allowed:
    filesystem_permissions:
      allow_read: true
      allow_write: true
      allow_directory_operations: true

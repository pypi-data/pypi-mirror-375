Driver of the Keithley 2400 source measure unit written for the measurement software [NOMAD-CAMELS](https://fau-lap.github.io/NOMAD-CAMELS/).

## Features

Currently supported are basic voltage and current setting and reading.

## Changes

### 0.1.4

- Added pyvisa as a dependency in pyproject.toml. Fixes errors when installing.

### 0.1.3

- Now does not turn off the output when a protocol ends that uses the Keithley 2400.

### 0.1.2

- Fixed bug when the instruments data format was not set to ASCII. Caused errors when reading data ("ascii codec can't decode byte 0x...").
Now automatically sets the data format to ASCII with `:FORM:DATA ASC` at the beginning of every measurement.

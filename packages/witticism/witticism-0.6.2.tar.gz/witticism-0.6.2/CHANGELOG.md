## [Unreleased]

## [0.6.2] - 2025-09-10

### 🔧 Fixed

#### Windows Installation Reliability
- **Resolved Windows compilation failures** - Switched from `webrtcvad>=2.0.10` to `webrtcvad-wheels>=2.0.14` to eliminate Visual C++ Build Tools requirement ([#88](https://github.com/Aaronontheweb/witticism/pull/88))
- **Eliminated installation errors** - Windows users no longer encounter "Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 or greater is required" error during installation
- **Pre-compiled binary wheels** - Installation now uses pre-built binaries for Windows, macOS, and Linux instead of requiring compilation
- **Maintained functionality** - Same API compatibility and voice activity detection performance as original webrtcvad

### 📊 Impact
This patch release resolves the most common Windows installation issue by switching to a dependency that provides pre-compiled binary wheels. Windows users can now install Witticism instantly without needing Visual Studio Build Tools, while maintaining identical functionality and performance.

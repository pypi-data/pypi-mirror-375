## Installation

### Option 1: Install with pip

```bash
pip install python-webflow-exporter
```

### Option 2: Run directly with uv (recommended for one-time use)

First, install `uv` if you haven't already:

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

**macOS (with Homebrew):**
```bash
brew install uv
```

**Windows:**
```bash
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

For other installation methods, see the [uv installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

Then run the tool directly:

```bash
uv tool run --from python-webflow-exporter webexp --url https://example.webflow.io
```

No installation required - `uv` will automatically handle dependencies and run the tool.

    """Find the faces of a graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    graph : :class:`compas.datastructures.Graph`
        The graph object.
    breakpoints : list, optional
        The vertices at which to break the found faces.

    Notes
    -----
    Breakpoints are primarily used to break up the outside face in between
    specific vertices. For example, in structural applications involving dual
    diagrams, any vertices where external forces are applied (loads or reactions)
    should be input as breakpoints.

    Warnings
    --------
    This algorithms is essentially a wall follower (a type of maze-solving algorithm).
    It relies on the geometry of the graph to be repesented as a planar,
    straight-line embedding. It determines an ordering of the neighboring vertices
    around each vertex, and then follows the *walls* of the graph, always
    taking turns in the same direction.

Surfa is a collection of Python utilities for medical image
analysis and mesh-based surface processing. It provides tools that operate on 3D image
arrays and triangular meshes with consideration of their representation in a world (or
scanner) coordinate system. While broad in scope, surfa is developed with particular
emphasis on neuroimaging applications.

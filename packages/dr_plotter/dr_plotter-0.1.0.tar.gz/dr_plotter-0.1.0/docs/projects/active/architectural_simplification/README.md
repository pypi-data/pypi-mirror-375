# Architectural Simplification Project

**Status**: Active - Problem Statements Phase  
**Priority**: Critical - Addresses systematic DR methodology violations  
**Timeline**: Multi-phase progressive simplification

## Project Overview

This project addresses severe architectural drift identified in the fresh eyes review. The dr_plotter codebase has accumulated complexity that directly violates its stated DR methodology, creating "random issues" through fragile interdependencies, defensive programming, and over-abstraction.

## Problem Context

**Root Issue**: What started as a simple matplotlib wrapper has grown into a complex system with multiple configuration hierarchies, fragmented state management, and defensive programming that hides real problems.

**Impact**: Users experience unpredictable behavior, validation failures, and high cognitive load due to accumulated architectural debt.

## Strategic Approach

**Progressive Simplification**: Address issues in dependency order to build confidence and reveal true architectural needs:

### Phase 1: Eliminate Defensive Programming
**Target**: Remove try-catch blocks, replace with assertions, surface real problems
**Rationale**: Defensive programming is hiding the actual configuration and state issues

### Phase 2: Decompose FigureManager  
**Target**: Split 876-line class into focused components with clear responsibilities
**Rationale**: Reveals natural boundaries and simplifies state management

### Phase 3: Simplify Legend System
**Target**: Reduce from 4 strategies to 1-2 clear options, eliminate positioning complexity
**Rationale**: Most visible source of user confusion and configuration chaos

### Phase 4: Configuration System Consolidation
**Target**: Merge overlapping config objects into single, clear interface
**Rationale**: Built on insights from phases 1-3, addresses root complexity source

## Success Metrics

- **Code Reduction**: Net decrease in lines while maintaining functionality
- **Cognitive Load**: Simpler user interface requiring less configuration knowledge
- **Error Clarity**: Predictable, immediate error feedback
- **DR Methodology Alignment**: Code structure directly reflects conceptual model

## Current Status

**Completed**: Fresh eyes review and architectural assessment  
**In Progress**: Problem statement creation for strategic collaboration  
**Next**: Strategic collaborator picks up individual problem statements

## Continuation Guide

Each problem statement in `problem_statements/` is designed for independent strategic collaboration and tactical execution. Implementation artifacts will be tracked in `phases/` as work progresses.

**Key Principle**: Apply "Leave No Trace" - eliminate complex systems completely rather than incremental fixes.

## Release Notes

### Version 0.2.0 - Complete SuperOps API Client

This release delivers a fully-functional Python SDK for the SuperOps MSP platform with comprehensive API coverage, modern async architecture, and enterprise-ready features.

**🎯 Major Achievements:**
- **16 API Managers** covering all SuperOps entities (Clients, Assets, Tickets, Projects, etc.)

from py_superops import SuperOpsClient

async with SuperOpsClient(api_key="your-api-key") as client:  # pragma: allowlist secret
    # List all tickets
    tickets = await client.tickets.list()

    # Create a new client
    new_client = await client.clients.create(
        name="Acme Corp",
        email="contact@acme.com"
    )

    # Execute automation workflow
    await client.automation.execute_workflow(
        workflow_id="backup-routine"
    )
```

**🖥️ CLI Usage:**
```bash
# Test connection
superops-cli test-connection

# List clients with rich output
superops-cli list-clients --output table

# Create a ticket
superops-cli create-ticket --title "Server maintenance" --priority high

# Execute GraphQL query
superops-cli query "{ clients { id name } }"
```

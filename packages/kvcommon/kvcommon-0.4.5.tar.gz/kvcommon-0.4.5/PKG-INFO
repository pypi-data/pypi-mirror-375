# KvCommon Python Utils

Library of miscellaneous common python utils that aren't worthy of their own dedicated libraries yet. Some of these packages will be moved out to their own libs later.

This library isn't likely to be useful to anyone else; it's just a convenience to save me from copy/pasting between various projects I work on.

### With Poetry:
`poetry add kvcommon`

## Running Options {#running-options}

Choose your preferred environment to work through these interactive Jupyter notebooks:

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- :material-laptop: **Run Locally**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jxnl/instructor.git
    cd instructor
    pip install -e ".[all]"
    jupyter notebook docs/tutorials/
    ```

- :material-google: **Google Colab**

    Look for the "Open in Colab" button at the top of each notebook

    Perfect for cloud execution without local setup

- :simple-mybinder: **Binder**

    Click the "Launch Binder" button to run instantly in your browser

    No installation or API keys required for basic examples

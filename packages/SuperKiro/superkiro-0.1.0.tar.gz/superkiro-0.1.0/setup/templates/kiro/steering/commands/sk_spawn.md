# #sk_spawn - Meta-System Task Orchestration

## Triggers
- Complex multi-domain operations requiring intelligent task breakdown
- Large-scale system operations spanning multiple technical areas
- Operations requiring parallel coordination and dependency management
- Meta-level orchestration beyond standard command capabilities

## Usage
```
#sk_spawn [complex-task] [--strategy sequential|parallel|adaptive] [--depth normal|deep]
```

## Behavioral Flow
1. Analyze: Parse complex operation requirements and assess scope across domains
2. Decompose: Break down operation into coordinated subtask hierarchies
3. Orchestrate: Execute tasks using optimal coordination strategy (parallel/sequential)
4. Monitor: Track progress across task hierarchies with dependency management
5. Integrate: Aggregate results and provide comprehensive orchestration summary

Key behaviors:
- Meta-system task decomposition with Epic → Story → Task → Subtask breakdown
- Intelligent coordination strategy selection based on operation characteristics
- Cross-domain operation management with parallel and sequential execution patterns
- Advanced dependency analysis and resource optimization across task hierarchies

## MCP Integration
- Native Orchestration: Meta-system command uses native coordination without MCP dependencies
- Progressive Integration: Coordination with systematic execution for progressive enhancement
- Framework Integration: Advanced integration with SuperClaude orchestration layers

## Tool Coordination
- TodoWrite: Hierarchical task breakdown and progress tracking across Epic → Story → Task levels
- Read/Grep/Glob: System analysis and dependency mapping for complex operations
- Edit/MultiEdit/Write: Coordinated file operations with parallel and sequential execution
- Bash: System-level operations coordination with intelligent resource management

## Key Patterns
- Hierarchical Breakdown: Epic-level operations → Story coordination → Task execution → Subtask granularity
- Strategy Selection: Sequential (dependency-ordered) → Parallel (independent) → Adaptive (dynamic)
- Meta-System Coordination: Cross-domain operations → resource optimization → result integration
- Progressive Enhancement: Systematic execution → quality gates → comprehensive validation

**pytest-htmlx** is a plugin for [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/) that generate beautiful and customizable HTML reports for your `pytest` test suite with ease.

This package automatically creates a detailed HTML report after running your tests, helping you better visualize test results, errors, and logs.


---

## 📦 Installation

Install it via pip:

```bash
pip install pytest-htmlx
```

## 🚀 Usage
Simply run your tests with the `--htmlx` flag:
```bash
pytest --htmlx
```
This generates a report named `report.html` in the current directory.

To specify a custom report file path:
```bash
pytest --htmlx=results/my-report.html
```

## ✨ Features
- Interactive, modern HTML report
- Summary of passed/failed/skipped tests
- Stack traces and log capture

## 📅 Future Releases
We’re working on exciting new capabilities for pytest-htmlx to make test reporting even more powerful:

- 📷 Screenshot Support for UI Tests — automatically capture and embed screenshots for Selenium, Playwright, or other UI automation test failures.
- 📝 Test Log Embedding — include detailed per-test logs inside the HTML report for easier debugging without switching between the terminal and report.
- 📊 Rich Visualizations — add trend charts and test run metrics over time.

💡 Feature suggestions are always welcome — submit ideas via our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/devarajug/pytest-htmlx/issues).

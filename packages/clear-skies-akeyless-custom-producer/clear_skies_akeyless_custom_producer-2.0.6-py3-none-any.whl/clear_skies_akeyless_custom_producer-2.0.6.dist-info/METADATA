# Clearskies Akeyless Custom Producer

This clearskies module provides endpoins for building custom producers and rotators in Akeyless.

Akeyless docs:

 * https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/custom-producer
 * https://docs.akeyless.io/docs/create-a-custom-rotated-secret

Documentation will eventually be published along with the rest of the official clearskies plugins via [https://clearskies.info](https://clearskies.info), but in the meantime you can find the docs [in the source code itself](./src/clearskies_akeyless_custom_producer/endpoints/no_input.py).

NOTE: these are the bindings for building your own custom Akeyless dynamic producers/rotators.  There is also a (slowly) building library of ready-made custom dynamic producers.  Those are kept in a separate github org just to avoid clutter in the main clear-skies space.  You can find them here:

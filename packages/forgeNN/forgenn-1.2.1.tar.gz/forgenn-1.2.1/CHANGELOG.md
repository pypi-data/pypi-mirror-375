# Changelog

All notable changes to forgeNN will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- (Docs) Clarified improved `mse` behavior (auto one-hot + regression reshaping) and availability of `model.summary()` in README.

### Changed
- Optimized training loop: removed redundant full-dataset forward after each epoch; metrics now aggregated on-the-fly (no API change).
- Fused stable softmax + cross-entropy implementation reduces intermediate allocations and duplicate exponentials.

### Fixed
- Ensured `mse` consistently handles (N,) integer class targets vs. (N,C) logits without user-side one-hot conversion.

### Performance
- Minor speed improvement from fused cross-entropy and eliminated extra per-epoch evaluation pass.

### Notes
- No breaking changes; public APIs (`compile().fit`, losses, metrics) unchanged.
- Dropped experimental acceleration path (Numba) before release—kept code lean and dependency surface minimal.

## [1.2.1] - 2025-09-09

### Added
- Keras-like `Sequential.summary()` method with symbolic shape inference:
  - Displays layer type (including attached activation), inferred output shape, and parameter counts
  - Automatically initializes lazily defined `Dense` layers when input feature size can be inferred
  - Supports optional `Input` layer to seed shape propagation or an explicit `input_shape` argument
- New `Input` layer (shape placeholder) exported at top level; integrates with summary and symbolic inference
- Auto one-hot + regression reshaping logic in `mse` improved (classification targets converted when 1D indices and logits are 2D)

### Changed
- Restored lazy initialization semantics for `Dense` during forward, while allowing summary to perform safe symbolic initialization when shapes are fully known
- Summary now keeps unresolvable shapes as `?` instead of forcing initialization (safer for partially dynamic pipelines)
- Documentation (guides) updated to reflect `Input` layer usage and model introspection via `model.summary()`

### Fixed
- Resolved missing `Sequential.summary` attribute caused by earlier nested definition bug
- Ensured parameter counts include activation-wrapped layers consistently

### Notes
- No breaking API changes; existing models continue to work
- `Input` layer is optional—models without it still summarize if `input_shape` is passed or shapes become inferable after first forward

### Upcoming (Planned)
- Potential inclusion of concatenation (`cat`) and stacking utilities per TODO roadmap
- Extended summary statistics (dtype, trainable flags) in future minor release


## [1.2.0] - 2025-09-08

### Added
- High-level layering API:
  - `Layer` base class and `ActivationWrapper` using the `@` operator to attach activations
  - `Sequential` container for ordered composition of layers
  - `Dense` (lazy init) and `Flatten` layers
  - Placeholders for `Conv2D` and `MaxPool2D` (raise NotImplementedError for now)
- Keras-like trainer utilities:
  - `compile(model, optimizer, loss, metrics)` returning a `CompiledModel`
  - `fit`, `evaluate`, and `predict` helpers
  - Built-in loss registry (`cross_entropy`) and metric registry (`accuracy`)
  - Mean Squared Error loss (`mse`) implemented in `forgeNN.vectorized` and registered in the trainer loss registry (usable via `loss="mse"` in `compile`)
- Documentation & guides:
  - New `SEQUENTIAL_GUIDE.md` explaining the Sequential API with comparisons to PyTorch and Keras
  - New `TRAINING_GUIDE.md` mapping Keras/PyTorch training to `compile/fit`
  - Updated `README.md` with `compile/fit` examples and guide links
- Examples:
  - New `examples/sequential_mnist.py` using `Sequential` and `compile/fit`
  - Updated `examples/benchmark_mnist.py` to use `Sequential + compile/fit` while keeping PyTorch comparison and plots
- Testing:
  - Expanded unit tests for `Sequential`, `Dense` lazy init, activation handling (string/class/callable), `Flatten`, nested `Sequential.zero_grad`, and optimizer momentum buffers
  - Ensured optimizer works with lazy-initialized `Dense` by performing a dummy forward prior to optimizer construction
- Public API:
  - Exported `Sequential`, `Dense`, `Flatten`, `ActivationWrapper`, and `compile` from the top-level package

### Changed
- Trainer stability and metric aggregation:
  - `CompiledModel.fit`/`evaluate` now aggregate loss and metrics weighted by batch size
  - `evaluate` computes accuracy via total correct/total samples for exact dataset accuracy
- Benchmark updates:
  - `examples/benchmark_mnist.py` now seeds NumPy for reproducibility and uses batch size 64
  - Per-epoch metrics are collected via `evaluate` to reduce jitter in plots
- Documentation/docstrings:
  - Comprehensive docstrings across `tensor.py` and `vectorized.py` with cleaned examples
  - Fixed `cross_entropy_loss` docstring to show correct gradient shape `(2, 2)`
 - Demo notebook training settings tuned for small datasets (increased epochs, reduced batch size, slightly higher learning rate) and updated to use the current `evaluate(X, y)` signature

### Deprecated
- Direct use of `VectorizedMLP`+manual training loops in examples in favor of `Sequential + compile/fit`
  - These APIs remain available for 1.x but are slated for removal/refactor in a future 2.x release
- Legacy training snippets in guides superseded by `compile/fit` sections

### Fixed
- Accuracy wobble in benchmarks by switching to sample-weighted aggregation and exact accuracy counting
- Lazy-init + optimizer ordering issue in tests by adding a dummy forward before optimizer/trainer creation
 - Implemented `mse` using graph composition (`(pred - target)**2 .mean()`) to ensure correct gradient scaling across all elements and robust broadcasting
 - Prevented unintended broadcasting for single-logit outputs by reshaping 1D targets `(N,)` to `(N, 1, ...)` when logits have singleton non-batch dimensions

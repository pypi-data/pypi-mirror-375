# misaem: Logistic Regression with Missing Covariates

`misaem` is a Python package that implements logistic regression for data with missing covariates. It is based on the **Stochastic Approximation of the Expectation-Maximization (SAEM)** algorithm. The algorithm relies on **Metropolis-Hastings sampling** within the MCMC step to handle the imputation of missing data, under the assumption that the covariates follow a **multi-variate normal distribution**.

This package provides a robust method for parameter estimation and prediction under **Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)** and **Missing At Random (MAR)** assumptions. It is a direct port of the misaem R package and is designed to integrate seamlessly with the scikit-learn ecosystem, adhering to its API conventions for ease of use.

## üåü Key Features

* **Robust Handling of Missing Data:** Employs the SAEM algorithm to handle missing covariate data during model fitting and prediction.

* **Predictive Power:** Can be used to make predictions on new, incomplete datasets.

* **scikit-learn Compatibility:** Follows scikit-learn's API, allowing for direct use in pipelines, cross-validation, and other standard workflows.

* **Statistical Foundation:** Provides estimated coefficients and their standard errors, enabling statistical inference.

## üíª Installation

You can install the package via `pip`:
```
pip install misaem
```


## üöÄ Getting Started

Here is a full example demonstrating how to use `SAEMLogisticRegression` to fit a model, make predictions, and visualize the results.



```
import numpy as np
from misaem import SAEMLogisticRegression
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


# 1. Generate Data
np.random.seed(1324)
n_train = 1000
n_test = 300
n_features = 5

cov = [[1,0.75,0.5,0.25,0],
       [0.75,1,0.75,0.5,0.25],
       [0.5,0.75,1,0.75,0.5],
       [0.25,0.5,0.75,1,0.75],
       [0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1]]

X = np.random.multivariate_normal(mean=np.zeros(n_features), cov=cov, size=n_train + n_test)
true_beta = np.hstack([0.5, np.random.normal(size=n_features)])
linear_pred = np.hstack([np.ones((n_train + n_test, 1)), X]) @ true_beta
probabilities = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-linear_pred))
y = np.random.binomial(1, probabilities)

X_missing = X.copy()
missing_mask = np.random.rand(n_train + n_test, n_features) < 0.2
X_missing[missing_mask] = np.nan

X_train = X_missing[:n_train,:]
X_test = X_missing[(n_train+1):]
y_train = y[:n_train]
y_test = y[(n_train+1):]

# 2. Fit SAEMLogisticRegression
model = SAEMLogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# 3. Predict on test set
preds = model.predict_proba(X_test, method="map")[:,1]

# 4. Evaluate
accuracy = np.mean((preds > 0.5) == y_test)
print(f"Accuracy of SAEMLogisticRegression: {accuracy:.4f}")

coef = model.coef_.ravel()
se = model.std_err_.ravel()[1:] # remove the intercept

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 4)) 
plt.errorbar(range(len(coef)), coef, yerr=1.96*se, fmt='o', label='Estimated Coef with 95% CI')
plt.xticks(range(len(coef)), [f'X{i}' for i in range(len(coef))])
plt.plot(range(len(coef)), true_beta[1:], 'o', color='red', label='True Coef')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

```

## ‚öôÔ∏è scikit-learn Integration

The misaem package is compatible with `scikit-learn`'s API, which allows you to seamlessly integrate it into your machine learning pipelines. For instance, you can combine it with data preprocessing steps like `StandardScaler`.

```
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from misaem import SAEMLogisticRegression

pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('scaler', StandardScaler()),
    ('model', SAEMLogisticRegression(random_state=42))
])

pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = pipeline.predict(X_test)

accuracy_pipeline = np.mean(y_pred == y_test)
print(f"Accuracy of SAEMLogisticRegression: {accuracy_pipeline:.4f}")

```

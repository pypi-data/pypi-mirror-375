# PyQuarks

**PyQuarks** is a compact, modular Python library for general-purpose data manipulation. Whether you're sorting, searching, transforming, or analyzing, PyQuarks offers a clean and reliable foundation for working with data.

This project is a curated library of reusable logic, organized for clarity, built for simplicity. While currently focused on core algorithmic tools, the long-term goal is to evolve PyQuarks into a lightweight framework for structured data workflows.

## Features

- **Core Modules**: Includes essential algorithms for sorting, searching, filtering, and transformation.
- **Zero Dependencies**: Built entirely with standard Python, no external libraries required.
- **Modular Structure**: Functions and classes are grouped logically for easy access and reuse.
- **Scalable Design**: Written with extensibility in mind, ready to grow as needed.

## Use Cases

- Rapid prototyping of algorithmic logic
- Educational reference for learning or teaching Python algorithms
- Lightweight utilities for data manipulation tasks
- Foundation for future library expansion

## Roadmap

- CLI interface for running selected modules
- Optional configuration system for chaining operations
- Expanded documentation and examples

## Vision

PyQuarks is about clarity, utility, and control. Itâ€™s a personal project built under constraints, with the goal of creating something useful, maintainable, and expandable.

## Getting Started

To start using PyQuarks, install via pip or clone the repository and explore the available [modules](./MODULES.md).

### PyPI (pip):
```bash
pip install pyquarks
```

### Clone Git
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Prospy006/pyquarks.git
cd pyquarks
```

### Example usage:

```py
import pyquarks

# Create a linked list
ll = pq.LinkedList()

# Insert values
ll.insert(420)
ll.insert(69)
ll.insert(6)

# Display list
ll.display() # output: [420, 69, 6]

# Delete byval or byind
ll.delete_byval(6) # deletes last value
ll.delete_byind(0) # deletes first value
ll.display() # output: [69]
```

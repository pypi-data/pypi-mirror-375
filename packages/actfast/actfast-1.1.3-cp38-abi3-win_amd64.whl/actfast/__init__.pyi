    """Read a raw actigraphy file and return a dictionary with metadata and data.

    The returned dictionary will contain the following:

    - "format": str: File format, any of "Actigraph GT3X", "Axivity CWA", "GeneActiv BIN", "Genea BIN", "Unknown WAV", "Unknown SQLite".
    - "metadata": Dict[str, Any]: Device specific key value pairs of metadata (e.g., device model, firmware version).
    - "timeseries": Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]]: Device specific key value pairs of "timeseries name" -> {timeseries data}, e.g.:
        - "high_frequency": Dict[str, Any]: High frequency timeseries data.
            - "datetime": 1D int64 numpy array of timestamps in nanoseconds (Unix epoch time).
            - Other data fields are various device specific sensor data, e.g.:
                - "acceleration": 2D numpy array (n_samples x 3) of acceleration data (x, y, z).
                - "light": 1D numpy array of light data.
                - "temperature": Temperature data.
                - ...
        - "low_frequency": Dict[str, Any]: Low frequency timeseries data.
            - Similar structure as high_frequency.

    Args:
        path (Union[str, Path, PathLike]): Path to the file.

    Returns:
        Dict[str, Any]: Dictionary with metadata and data.

    Raises:
        IOError: If the file is not found or corrupted.

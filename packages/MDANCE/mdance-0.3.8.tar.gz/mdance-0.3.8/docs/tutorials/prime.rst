PRIME Tutorial
==============

.. contents::
   :local:
   :depth: 2

Overview
--------

This clustering tutorial is meant for datasets Molecular Dynamics
Trajectory. PRIME assumes a MD trajectory that has a well-sampled
ensemble of conformations. The PRIME algorithm predicts the native
structure of a protein from simulation or clustering data. These methods
perfectly mapped all the structural motifs in the studied systems and
required unprecedented linear scaling.

Tutorial
--------

The following tutorial will guide you through the process of determining
the native structure of a biomolecule using the PRIME algorithm. If you
do not have clustered data. Please refer to other clustering algorithms
such as `NANI <nani.html>`__ to cluster your data, follow all steps.

1. Clone the MDANCE Repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First things first, clone the MDANCE repository if you haven't already.

.. code:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/mqcomplab/MDANCE.git
    $ cd MDANCE/scripts/prime

2. Cluster Normalization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`normalize.py <https://github.com/mqcomplab/MDANCE/blob/main/scripts/prime/normalize.py>`__ With
already clustered data, this script will normalize the trajectory data
between :math:`[0,1]` using the Min-Max Normalization.

::

   # System info - EDIT THESE
   input_top = '../../examples/md/aligned_tau.pdb'
   unnormed_cluster_dir = '../outputs/labels_*'
   output_dir = 'normed_clusters'
   output_base_name = 'normed_clusttraj'
   atomSelection = 'resid 3 to 12 and name N CA C O H'
   n_clusters = 6

Inputs
^^^^^^

System info
'''''''''''

| ``input_top`` is the topology file used in the clustering.
| ``unnormed_cluster_dir`` is the directory where the clustering files are located from step 3. 
| ``output_dir`` is the directory where the normalized clustering files will be saved. 
| ``output_base_name`` is the base name for the output files. 
| ``atomSelection`` is the atom selection used in the clustering. 
| ``n_clusters`` is the number of clusters used in the PRIME. If number less than total number of cluster, it will take top *n* number of clusters.

Execution
^^^^^^^^^

Make sure your pwd is ``$PATH/MDANCE/scripts/prime``.

.. code:: bash

   $ python normalize.py

Outputs
^^^^^^^

| ``normed_clusttraj.c*.npy`` files, normalized clustering files.
| ``normed_data.npy``, appended all normed files together.

3. Similarity Calculations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``prime_sim`` generates a similarity dictionary from running PRIME.

| ``-h``    Help with the argument options.
| ``-m``    Methods, {pairwise, union, medoid, outlier} (*required*).
| ``-n``    Number of clusters (*required*).
| ``-i``    Similarity index, {RR or SM} (*required*).
| ``-t``    Fraction of outliers to trim in decimals (default is None).
| ``-w``    Weighing clusters by frames it contains (default is True).
| ``-d``    Directory where the ``normed_clusttraj.c*.npy`` files are located (*required*)
| ``-s``    Location where ``summary`` file is located with population of each cluster (*required*)

Execution
^^^^^^^^^

Make sure your pwd is ``$PATH/MDANCE/scripts/prime``.

.. code:: bash

    $ prime_sim -m union -n 6 -i SM -t 0.1  -d normed_clusters -s ../nani/outputs/summary_6.csv

To generate a similarity dictionary using data in
`normed_clusters <https://github.com/mqcomplab/MDANCE/tree/main/scripts/prime/normed_clusters>`__ (make sure you
are in the prime directory) using the ``union`` method (2.2 in *Fig 2*) and
Sokal Michener index. In addition, 10% of the outliers were trimmed. 

.. _outputs-1:

Outputs
^^^^^^^

| ``w_union_SM_t10.txt`` file with the similarity dictionary. 
| The result is a dictionary organized as followes: 

.. code:: plaintext

    {
        "frame_0": [   
            0.7,    # cluster 1 similarity.
            0.9,    # cluster 2 similarity.
            ...,
            0.8     # average similarity of all above similarities.
        ] 
    }
    
4. Representative Frames
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``prime_rep`` will determine the native structure of the protein using
the similarity dictionary generated in step 5.

| ``-h``    for help with the argument options. 
| ``-m``    methods (for one method, None for all methods).
| ``-s``    folder to access for ``w_union_SM_t10.txt`` file.
| ``-i``    similarity index (*required*)
| ``-t``    Fraction of outliers to trim in decimals (default is None).
| ``-d``    directory where the ``normed_clusttraj.c*`` files are located (required if method is None)

.. _example-1:

Execution
^^^^^^^^^

Make sure your pwd is ``$PATH/MDANCE/scripts/prime``.

.. code:: bash

    $ prime_rep -m union -s outputs -d normed_clusters -t 0.1 -i SM

.. _outputs-2:

Outputs
^^^^^^^

``w_rep_SM_t10_union.txt`` file with the representative frames index.

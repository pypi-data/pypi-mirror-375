# CANFAR Governance

The CANFAR project is operated by the [Canadian Astronomy Data Centre (CADC)](https://www.cadc-ccda.hia-iha.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/en/) on behalf of the Canadian astronomy research community. Enhancement and allocation of the capacity of CANFAR (both operational and resource-related) are overseen by the [**Science Management Committee (SMC)**](#science-management-committee).

The SMC is composed of Canadian researchers leading projects that make significant use of the CANFAR platform. The chair of the SMC rotates among its members and is responsible for organizing SMC meetings as needed and reporting decisions to the operator, i.e. CADC.  

In addition, one SMC member serves as the lead for the [**Digital Research Alliance Canada (DRAC)**](https://alliancecan.ca/en) resource allocation request, the cyber-infrastructure resource that enables CANFAR. The SMC meets periodically, nominally at the annual [*Canadian Astronomical Society of Canada (CASCA)*](https://casca.ca) meeting and at other times via teleconference when issues arise, such as the operator (CADC) requesting direction on significant technology choices.

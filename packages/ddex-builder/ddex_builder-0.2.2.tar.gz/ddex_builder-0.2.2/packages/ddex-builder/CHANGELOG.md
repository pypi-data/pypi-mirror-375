### API Reference

#### Core Builder API
```rust
use ddex_builder::{Builder, BuildRequest, OutputFormat};

// Create builder with preset
let mut builder = Builder::new();
builder.preset("spotify_audio_43")?;

// Build DDEX XML
let request = BuildRequest {
    // ... release data
};

let result = builder.build_internal(&request)?;
```

#### Advanced Configuration
```rust
use ddex_builder::{DeterminismConfig, SecurityConfig};

// Configure determinism
let determinism = DeterminismConfig {
    verify_determinism: Some(5), // Verify with 5 iterations
    ..Default::default()
};

// Configure security
let security = SecurityConfig {
    max_xml_size: 10_000_000,    // 10MB limit
    rate_limiting_enabled: true,
    ..Default::default()
};

builder.set_determinism_config(determinism);
builder.set_security_config(security);
```

#### Validation and Analysis
```rust
// Validate generated XML
let validation_result = builder.validate(&result.xml)?;

// Analyze performance
println!("Build time: {}ms", result.stats.generation_time_ms);
println!("XML size: {} bytes", result.stats.xml_size_bytes);
println!("Releases: {}", result.stats.releases);
println!("Tracks: {}", result.stats.tracks);
```

### Performance Benchmarks

Measured on Apple M1 Pro, 16GB RAM:

| Scenario | Build Time | Memory Usage | Notes |
|----------|------------|--------------|-------|
| **Single Track Release** | 3.2ms ± 0.2ms | 4MB | Typical single release |
| **Album (10 tracks)** | 8.7ms ± 0.5ms | 8MB | Standard album |
| **Large Album (20+ tracks)** | 15.4ms ± 1.2ms | 12MB | Concept album/compilation |
| **Batch (100 releases)** | 180ms ± 10ms | 45MB | Label catalog processing |
| **Streaming (1000+ releases)** | 1.8s ± 100ms | 15MB | Constant memory usage |

### Migration Guide

#### From XML-based Solutions
If you're migrating from custom XML generation:

1. **Install DDEX Builder**: `cargo add ddex-builder`
2. **Choose a Preset**: Start with a platform-specific preset
3. **Map Your Data**: Convert your data structures to `BuildRequest`
4. **Validate Output**: Use built-in validation to ensure compliance
5. **Test Integration**: Verify with your distribution partners

#### From Other DDEX Libraries
```rust
// Old approach (example)
let xml = custom_ddex_lib::build_release(&data)?;

// New approach with DDEX Builder
let mut builder = Builder::new();
builder.preset("spotify_audio_43")?;
let result = builder.build_internal(&request)?;
let xml = result.xml;
```

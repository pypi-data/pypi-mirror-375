IMPORTANT: Output a read-only SQL query that returns data with these exact column names

The returned query must return columns matching these exact names (case-sensitive). Use aliases and casting to transform database columns into this format.

ALWAYS ENCLOSE ALL IDENTIFIERS (TABLE NAMES, COLUMN NAMES) IN QUOTES TO PRESERVE CASE SENSITIVITY AND AVOID RESERVED WORD CONFLICTS AND SYNTAX ERRORS.

Instructions:
    1. ONLY write read-only queries for tables that have been explicitly discovered or referenced
    2. Always use the exact table and column names as they appear in the schema, respecting case sensitivity
    3. Before writing queries, make sure you understand the schema of the tables you are querying.
    4. When a query fails or returns unexpected results, try to diagnose the issue and then retry.
    5. Use the query tool to validate your results before providing the final working query.

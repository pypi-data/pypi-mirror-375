# DConfusion
A Python package for working with confusion matrices.

## Overview
`dconfusion` is a lightweight Python package that provides basic statistical functionality for working with confusion matrices. Confusion matrices are a crucial tool in machine learning and data analysis, allowing you to evaluate the performance of classification models.

## Features
* Basic confusion matrix representation
* Frequency calculation for each cell in the matrix

## Installation
You can install `dconfusion` using pip:

```bash
pip install dconfusion
```

Usage
Here's an example of how to use dconfusion:

# Binary classification (existing usage)
``` python
binary_cm = DConfusion(80, 70, 10, 20)
```

# Multi-class from matrix
``` python
multiclass_cm = DConfusion(
    confusion_matrix=[[50, 3, 2], [8, 45, 1], [4, 2, 48]], 
    labels=['Cat', 'Dog', 'Bird']
)
```

# Multi-class from predictions
``` python
y_true = ['Cat', 'Dog', 'Bird', 'Cat', 'Dog']
y_pred = ['Cat', 'Dog', 'Cat', 'Cat', 'Dog']  
cm = DConfusion.from_predictions(y_true, y_pred)
```

# Get class-specific metrics
``` python
# Get metrics for a specific class
cat_metrics = multiclass_cm.get_class_metrics(class_label='Cat')
# Returns: {'precision': 0.91, 'recall': 0.83, 'f1_score': 0.87, 'specificity': 0.95}
```

# Get overall metrics
```
overall_metrics = multiclass_cm.get_all_metrics()
```

```python
from dconfusion import *

cm = DConfusion(80, 70, 10, 20)

print(cm)

print(cm.frequency())

print(f"""Specificity: {cm.get_specificity():^15.2f}""")
print(f"""Sensitivity: {cm.get_sensitivity():^15.2f}""")
print(f"""Accuracy: {cm.get_accuracy():^15.2f}""")
print(f"""Precision: {cm.get_precision():^15.2f}""")
print(f"""F1 Score: {cm.get_f1_score():^15.2f}""")
print(f"""Matthews Correlation: {cm.get_matthews_correlation_coefficient():^15.2f}""")
```

# Roadmap
This is the initial release (v0.2) of dconfusion, and we plan to add more features in future releases. Some potential features include:
- Additional statistical metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score)
- Integration with popular machine learning libraries

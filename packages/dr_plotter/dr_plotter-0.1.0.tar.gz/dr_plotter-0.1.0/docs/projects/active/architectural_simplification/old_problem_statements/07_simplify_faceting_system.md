# Problem Statement: Simplify Faceting System

**Priority**: 2 (High Value)

## Strategic Objective

Simplify the faceting system's implementation and eliminate unnecessary abstraction layers while preserving essential functionality: complex multi-variable faceting, style coordination across subplots, and advanced subplot targeting. This removes implementation complexity without sacrificing the power features that make faceting valuable.

## Problem Context

The faceting system has valuable sophisticated functionality hidden behind over-engineered implementation:

**Implementation Over-Engineering** (Remove These):
- **6 separate modules** creating unnecessary abstraction layers
- **Performance optimization complexity** (separate pipelines for >1000 rows)
- **Complex validation chains** with difflib integration for error suggestions
- **"Metadata about metadata"** abstractions that obscure simple operations

**Valuable Functionality** (Must Preserve):
- **Complex multi-variable faceting** - grouping by multiple columns with sophisticated layouts
- **Style coordination** - consistent styling across subplots with legend integration
- **Advanced targeting** - flexible subplot positioning and arrangement
- **Visual consistency** - professional output that works across different data patterns

**Evidence of Implementation Problems**:
```python
# Current - complex abstractions for simple operations
from dr_plotter.faceting import (
    analyze_data_dimensions,           # Just needs data[col].unique()
    compute_grid_layout_metadata,      # Metadata for basic grid math
    validate_faceting_data_requirements, # Complex validation for simple checks
    # BUT these provide real value:
    resolve_target_positions,          # Advanced targeting is genuinely useful
    FacetStyleCoordinator,             # Style coordination solves real problems
)
```

**Real Problems to Address**:
- **Implementation complexity** obscures straightforward data operations
- **Unnecessary abstraction** creates cognitive overhead for maintainers
- **Performance optimization** adds complexity without clear benefit

## Requirements & Constraints

### Must Preserve  
- **Complex multi-variable faceting** - grouping by multiple columns with sophisticated arrangements
- **Style coordination across subplots** - consistent visual styling and legend integration
- **Advanced targeting capabilities** - flexible subplot positioning and custom arrangements
- **Visual output quality** - professional appearance across different data patterns
- **FacetingConfig interface** - current user configuration patterns

### Must Simplify
- **Implementation complexity** - eliminate unnecessary abstraction layers  
- **Module organization** - consolidate 6 modules into focused components
- **Performance optimization overhead** - remove separate pipelines and complex optimizations
- **Validation complexity** - replace complex chains with simple assertions
- **"Metadata about metadata"** - direct operations instead of abstract descriptions

### Cannot Break
- **Multi-variable faceting** - current complex grouping patterns continue working
- **Style coordination** - subplot styling consistency maintained
- **Advanced targeting** - flexible subplot positioning preserved  
- **Integration points** - FigureManager and existing examples work identically

## Decision Frameworks

### Implementation Simplification Strategy
**Option A**: Keep current functionality, eliminate abstraction layers and complex validation
**Option B**: Consolidate modules while preserving sophisticated features (multi-variable, targeting, style coordination)  
**Option C**: Rewrite from scratch with focus on essential features only

**Decision Criteria**:

**Recommended**: Option B - consolidate modules, preserve sophisticated functionality, eliminate over-abstraction

### Module Organization Strategy
**Option A**: Single faceting.py module with all functionality

**Option D**: Keep current 6 modules but simplify each one

**Decision Criteria**:
- Reduce cognitive load for developers
- Maintain clear separation of sophisticated features
- Enable focused testing and maintenance
- Align with natural functional boundaries

**Recommended**: Option C - three focused modules that preserve sophisticated capabilities

### Complexity Elimination Strategy  
**Option A**: Remove performance optimizations and complex validation, keep functionality
**Option B**: Simplify implementation while preserving all current features
**Option C**: Eliminate edge cases and advanced features for simplicity
**Option D**: Keep complexity but improve interfaces and documentation

**Decision Criteria**:
- Eliminate complexity that doesn't serve real user needs
- Preserve functionality that provides genuine value
- Reduce maintenance burden for developers
- Maintain professional visual output quality

**Recommended**: Option A - remove optimization complexity, preserve functional sophistication

## Success Criteria

## Quality Standards

**Reference**: Follow `docs/processes/design_philosophy.md` principles

**Key Principles Applied**:
- **Clarity Through Structure**: Clear module organization that separates sophisticated features logically
- **Succinct and Self-Documenting**: Direct implementation without unnecessary abstraction layers
- **Architectural Courage**: Bold elimination of optimization complexity while preserving valuable functionality

**Revised Faceting Architecture**:
```python
# Three focused modules preserving sophisticated capabilities

# Module 1: faceting/data_grouping.py - Multi-variable grouping logic
class MultiVariableGrouper:
    def group_data(self, data: DataFrame, row_vars: List[str], col_vars: List[str]) -> GroupedData:
        # Sophisticated multi-variable grouping - preserve this complexity
        # Direct pandas operations - eliminate unnecessary abstraction
        
# Module 2: faceting/grid_computation.py - Advanced targeting and layouts  
class GridComputer:
    def compute_advanced_layout(self, grouped_data: GroupedData, targeting_config: TargetingConfig) -> GridLayout:
        # Advanced targeting logic - preserve this sophistication
        # Direct grid computation - eliminate "metadata about metadata"
        
# Module 3: faceting/style_coordination.py - Subplot styling consistency
class SubplotStyleCoordinator:
    def coordinate_styles(self, grid_layout: GridLayout, style_config: StyleConfig) -> CoordinatedStyles:
        # Style coordination across subplots - preserve this valuable feature
        # Direct style application - eliminate complex coordination abstractions
```

**Implementation Simplification Standards**:
- **Preserve sophisticated functionality** - multi-variable faceting, targeting, style coordination are valuable
- **Eliminate implementation complexity** - remove abstraction layers and optimization overhead  
- **Direct operations** - use pandas and matplotlib directly instead of creating abstractions
- **Focused modules** - each module handles one sophisticated capability clearly
- **Simple validation** - basic assertions instead of complex validation chains

## Adaptation Guidance

### Expected Discoveries
- **Edge cases** currently handled by complex validation
- **Performance optimizations** embedded in current abstraction layers
- **Integration complexity** between faceting and other systems
- **User workflow patterns** that inform optimal simple interface

### Handling Simplification Challenges
- **If edge cases are complex**: Document limitations rather than adding complex handling
- **If performance suffers**: Optimize simple implementation rather than adding abstraction
- **If integration breaks**: Simplify integration interfaces rather than preserving complex internal logic
- **If users need more control**: Add simple parameters rather than complex configuration objects

### Implementation Strategy
- **Start with clean slate** - implement simple faceting from scratch rather than modifying complex system
- **Test with real examples** - ensure simplified system handles actual user needs
- **Benchmark performance** - verify that simplification doesn't hurt performance
- **Gradual replacement** - run new system alongside old until confidence is high

## Documentation Requirements

### Implementation Documentation

- **Before/after comparison** demonstrating complexity reduction
- **Performance benchmarks** comparing simple vs complex implementation
- **Integration guide** for how simplified faceting works with other components

### Strategic Insights

**Key Success Indicator**: When faceting system is simplified, developers should be able to understand and modify faceting implementation quickly by working with three focused modules (data grouping, grid computation, style coordination), while users continue to get all current sophisticated functionality (multi-variable faceting, advanced targeting, style coordination) without any reduction in capabilities or visual quality.

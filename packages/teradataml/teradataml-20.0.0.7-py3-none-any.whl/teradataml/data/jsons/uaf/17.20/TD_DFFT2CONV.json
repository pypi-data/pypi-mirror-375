Also, it may output different payload types such as AMPL_PHASE_DEGREES, MULTIVAR_AMPL_PHASE_RADIANS, COMPLEX, etc. In normal workflow the user may want a different result form in order to pass the results to another AF, plot the results in human readable form, compare the results to python, etc. Instead of rerunning TD_DFFT2 to produce a different result form, TD_DFFT2CONV can be used to accomplish the task faster and with less memory consumption.

            Adding a lock here ensures that the acquire logic is atomic, but it also means that the

                most async programs.
            The benefit is that with multiple concurrent requests, we can ensure that the bucket level
                is updated correctly and that we don't have multiple requests trying to update the bucket level
                at the same time, which could lead to an inconsistent state i.e. a race condition.

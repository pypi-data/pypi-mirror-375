description = '''PyRuSH is the python implementation of RuSH (Rule-based sentence Segmenter using Hashing), which is originally developed using Java. RuSH is an efficient, reliable, and easy adaptable rule-based sentence segmentation solution. It is specifically designed to handle the telegraphic written text in clinical note. It leverages a nested hash table to execute simultaneous rule processing, which reduces the impact of the rule-base growth on execution time and eliminates the effect of rule order on accuracy.

class Upgrade:
    """
    A class to manage package operations on a remote system using `apk` (Alpine Linux package manager).

    Attributes:
        sudo (bool): If `True`, the commands will be executed with `sudo` privileges.
        su (bool): If `True`, the commands will be executed with `su` privileges.

    Usage:
        Upgrade installed packages.

    Notes:
        - Commands are constructed based on the `present`, `sudo`, and `su` flags.
        - The `changed` flag is set if the package state changes after execution.

    """
    Enable thread-level core binding to allocate specific CPU cores for key MindSpore modules (main thread, pynative,
    runtime, and minddata), preventing performance instability caused by CPU core contention among MindSpore threads.

    Note:
        - Flexible Core Binding Configuration:

          1. When `affinity_cpu_list` is not specified, the process automatically determines the CPU affinity range
             based on available CPU cores, NUMA nodes, and device resources in the environment.
          2. When `affinity_cpu_list` is specified, the process manually binds to the CPU range defined in
             `affinity_cpu_list`.
          3. When `module_to_cpu_dict` is not specified, the default bind-core strategy assigns the CPU
             cores to the `"main"` module.
          4. When `module_to_cpu_dict` is specified, the process manually binds each module to CPU ranges as
             defined in `module_to_cpu_dict`.
        - The automated bind-core strategy generation scenario invokes system commands to obtain CPU, NUMA node, and
          device resources on the environment, and some commands cannot be executed successfully due to environment
          differences; the automated bind-core strategy generated will vary according to the resources available on the
          environment:

          1. `cat /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset/cpuset.cpus`, to obtain the available CPU resources on the environment; if the
             execution of this command fails, the bind-core function will not take effect.
          2. `npu-smi info -m`, get the available NPU resources on the environment; if the execution of this command
             fails, the bind-core strategy will be generated only based on the available CPU resources,
             without considering the device affinity.
          3. `npu-smi info -t board -i {NPU_ID} -c {CHIP_ID}`, get NPU details based on the logical ID of the device;
             if the execution of this command fails, the bind-core strategy is generated based on the available CPU
             resources only, regardless of device affinity.
          4. `lspci -s {PCIe_No} -vvv`, get the hardware information of the device on the environment; if the execution
             of this command fails, the bind-core strategy is generated only based on the available CPU resources,
             without considering the device affinity.
          5. `lscpu`, get information about CPUs and NUMA nodes on the environment; if the execution of this command
             fails, only the available CPU resources are used to generate the bind-core strategy, without considering
             the device affinity.

    Args:
        enable_affinity (bool): Enables/disables thread-level core binding.
        affinity_cpu_list (list, optional): Manually specifies the CPU affinity range for the process. Format:
            `["cpuidX-cpuidY"]` (e.g., ``["0-3", "8-11"]``). Default: ``None`` (uses auto-generated binding strategy
            based on system resources). Passing an empty list `[]` behaves the same as ``None``.
        module_to_cpu_dict (dict, optional): Customizes core binding for specific modules. Valid keys
            (module names) are ``"main"``, ``"runtime"``, ``"pynative"``, ``"minddata"``. Valid value is a list
            of ``int`` indices representing CPU cores (e.g., ``{"main": [0,1], "minddata": [6,7]}``).
            Default: ``None`` (automatically binds core for module `"main"`). Passing an empty dict `{}`
            behaves the same as ``None``.

        TypeError: The `enable_affinity` parameter is not a boolean.
        TypeError: The `affinity_cpu_list` parameter is neither a list nor ``None``.
        TypeError: An element in `affinity_cpu_list` is not a string.
        ValueError: An element in `affinity_cpu_list` does not follow the ``["cpuidX-cpuidY"]`` format.
        TypeError: The `module_to_cpu_dict` parameter is neither a dictionary nor ``None``.
        TypeError: A key in `module_to_cpu_dict` is not a string.
        TypeError: A value in `module_to_cpu_dict` is not a list.
        ValueError: An element in `module_to_cpu_dict` values is not a non-negative integer.

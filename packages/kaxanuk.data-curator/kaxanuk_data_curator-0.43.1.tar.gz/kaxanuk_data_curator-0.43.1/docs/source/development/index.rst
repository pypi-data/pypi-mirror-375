=================

Welcome! Thank you for considering contributing to **Data Curator**.

Who We Are

Why We're Doing This
--------------------
Our mission with Data Curator is to enhance **reproducibility** and **auditability** in financial research by building robust and accessible tools for the development of investment strategies.

Investment research often struggles with limited transparency, fragmented workflows, and a lack of robust tooling. Too much time is spent manually structuring raw data, cleaning datasets, and testing new data providers, repetitive tasks that drain resources and delay insights.

Data Curator addresses these challenges by offering open-source tools that enable reproducible, traceable, and efficient data workflows.

Share Your Calculation Modules
--------------------------------

Have an idea for a new financial indicator or analytical function?
We invite you to contribute new calculation modules.
If it meets the quality standards, your code could become part of the official library.

Help Grow the Ecosystem
-------------------------

Beyond calculations, there are many ways to contribute:

- Improve documentation and add usage examples
- Develop new data providers
- Build integrations with other research tools or platforms

Together we can grow a powerful and useful ecosystem.

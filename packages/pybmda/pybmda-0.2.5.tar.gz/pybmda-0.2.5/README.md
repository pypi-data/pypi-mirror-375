# pybmda
Python interface for BlackMagicDebugApplication (BMDA)

To use, place the `blackmagic-bmda` or `blackmagic-bmda.exe` executable in the PATH or in the working folder.

BMDA can be obtained through the [official repository's releases](https://github.com/blackmagic-debug/blackmagic/releases).

To override the path of `blackmagic-bmda` with another binary, set `pybmda.utils.BMDA_BINARY` with the path as a string.

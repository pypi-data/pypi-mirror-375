Dear future controls engineer,

Some geobricks which control BL08J components have
names in the BL08I domain for historical reasons and
to add confusion.

For example, BL08I-MO-STEP-06 lives in BL08I-MO-RACK-02
but controls BL08J M2 and D1. Whilst BL08J-MO-STEP-02
does not have an equivalent I-branch identifier.

I have given each of these bricks a name in the BL08J
domain, in order to logically separate the two branches 
in the control system. The I branch name is mapped to
the J branch name using soft links in this directory.

====================================================================================
I-branch name       J-branch name       Purpose
====================================================================================
N/A                 BL08J-MO-STEP-01    BL08J Sample stages, Zone plate
N/A                 BL08J-MO-STEP-02    BL08J OSA, Hotel, Robot and S1 (S3) shutter
BL08I-MO-STEP-06    BL08J-MO-STEP-06    BL08J M2 and D1 (D7)
BL08I-MO-STEP-07    BL08J-MO-STEP-07    BL08J S1 (S3) and D2 (D8)

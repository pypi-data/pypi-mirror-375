*species* is a toolkit for atmospheric characterization of directly imaged exoplanets. It provides a coherent framework for spectral and photometric analysis which builds on publicly-available data and models from various resources.

There are tools available for grid and free retrievals using Bayesian inference, synthetic photometry, interpolating a variety atmospheric and evolutionary model grids (including the possibility to add a custom grid), color-magnitude and color-color diagrams, empirical spectral analysis, spectral and photometric calibration, and analysis of emission lines. The package has been released on `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/species/>`_ and is actively developed and maintained on `Github <https://github.com/tomasstolker/species>`_.

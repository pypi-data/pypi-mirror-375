[3.1.0] - 2023-06-02

  length should be padded or lead to a ``ValueError``
* improve consistency of exception messages between the C++ and pure Python implementation
* upgrade required Cython version to ``Cython==3.0.0b3``

Fixed
~~~~~
* fix missing GIL restore when an exception is thrown inside ``process.cdist``
* fix incorrect type hints for the ``process`` module

[3.0.0] - 2023-04-16
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Changed
~~~~~~~
* allow the usage of ``Hamming`` for different string lengths. Length differences are handled as
  insertions / deletions
* remove support for boolean preprocessor functions in ``rapidfuzz.fuzz`` and ``rapidfuzz.process``.
  The processor argument is now always a callable or ``None``.
* update defaults of the processor argument to be ``None`` everywhere. For affected functions this can change results, since strings are no longer preprocessed.
  To get back the old behaviour pass ``processor=utils.default_process`` to these functions.
  The following functions are affected by this:

  * ``process.extract``, ``process.extract_iter``, ``process.extractOne``
  * ``fuzz.token_sort_ratio``, ``fuzz.token_set_ratio``, ``fuzz.token_ratio``, ``fuzz.partial_token_sort_ratio``, ``fuzz.partial_token_set_ratio``, ``fuzz.partial_token_ratio``, ``fuzz.WRatio``, ``fuzz.QRatio``

* ``rapidfuzz.process`` no longer calls scorers with ``processor=None``. For this reason user provided scorers no longer require this argument.
* remove option to pass keyword arguments to scorer via ``**kwargs`` in ``rapidfuzz.process``. They can be passed
  via a ``scorer_kwargs`` argument now. This ensures this does not break when extending function parameters and
  prevents naming clashes.
* remove ``rapidfuzz.string_metric`` module. Replacements for all functions are available in ``rapidfuzz.distance``

Added
~~~~~
* added support for arbitrary hashable sequence in the pure Python fallback implementation of all functions in ``rapidfuzz.distance``
* added support for ``None`` and ``float("nan")`` in ``process.cdist`` as long as the underlying scorer supports it.
  This is the case for all scorers returning normalized results.

[1.2.1] - 2021-03-08
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~
* further improve bitparallel implementation of uniform Levenshtein distance for strings with a length > 64 (in many cases more than 50% faster)

[1.2.0] - 2021-03-07
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Changed
~~~~~~~
* add more benchmarks to documentation

Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~
* add bitparallel implementation to InDel Distance (Levenshtein with the weights 1,1,2) for strings with a length > 64
* improve bitparallel implementation of uniform Levenshtein distance for strings with a length > 64
* use the InDel Distance and uniform Levenshtein distance in more cases instead of the generic implementation
* Directly use the Levenshtein implementation in C++ instead of using it through Python in process.*

[1.1.2] - 2021-03-03
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Fixed
~~~~~
* Fix reference counting in process.extract (see #81)

[1.1.1] - 2021-02-23
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Fixed
~~~~~
* Fix result conversion in process.extract (see #79)

[1.1.0] - 2021-02-21
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Changed
~~~~~~~
* string_metric.normalized_levenshtein supports now all weights
* when different weights are used for Insertion and Deletion the strings are not swapped inside the Levenshtein implementation anymore. So different weights for Insertion and Deletion are now supported.
* replace C++ implementation with a Cython implementation. This has the following advantages:

  * The implementation is less error prone, since a lot of the complex things are done by Cython
  * slightly faster than the current implementation (up to 10% for some parts)
  * about 33% smaller binary size
  * reduced compile time

* Added \*\*kwargs argument to process.extract/extractOne/extract_iter that is passed to the scorer
* Add max argument to hamming distance
* Add support for whole Unicode range to utils.default_process

Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~
* replaced Wagner Fischer usage in the normal Levenshtein distance with a bitparallel implementation

[1.0.2] - 2021-02-19
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Fixed
~~~~~
* The bitparallel LCS algorithm in fuzz.partial_ratio did not find the longest common substring properly in some cases.
  The old algorithm is used again until this bug is fixed.

[1.0.1] - 2021-02-17
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Changed
~~~~~~~
* string_metric.normalized_levenshtein supports now the weights (1, 1, N) with N >= 1

Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~
* The Levenshtein distance with the weights (1, 1, >2) do now use the same implementation as the weight (1, 1, 2), since
  ``Substitution > Insertion + Deletion`` has no effect

Fixed
~~~~~
* fix uninitialized variable in bitparallel Levenshtein distance with the weight (1, 1, 1)

[1.0.0] - 2021-02-12
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Changed
~~~~~~~
* all normalized string_metrics can now be used as scorer for process.extract/extractOne
* Implementation of the C++ Wrapper completely refactored to make it easier to add more scorers, processors and string matching algorithms in the future.
* increased test coverage, that already helped to fix some bugs and help to prevent regressions in the future
* improved docstrings of functions

Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~
* Added bit-parallel implementation of the Levenshtein distance for the weights (1,1,1) and (1,1,2).
* Added specialized implementation of the Levenshtein distance for cases with a small maximum edit distance, that is even faster, than the bit-parallel implementation.
* Improved performance of ``fuzz.partial_ratio``
  -> Since ``fuzz.ratio`` and ``fuzz.partial_ratio`` are used in most scorers, this improves the overall performance.
* Improved performance of ``process.extract`` and ``process.extractOne``

Deprecated
~~~~~~~~~~
* the ``rapidfuzz.levenshtein`` module is now deprecated and will be removed in v2.0.0
  These functions are now placed in ``rapidfuzz.string_metric``. ``distance``\ , ``normalized_distance``\ , ``weighted_distance`` and ``weighted_normalized_distance`` are combined into ``levenshtein`` and ``normalized_levenshtein``.

Added
~~~~~
* added normalized version of the hamming distance in ``string_metric.normalized_hamming``
* process.extract_iter as a generator, that yields the similarity of all elements, that have a similarity >= score_cutoff

Fixed
~~~~~
* multiple bugs in extractOne when used with a scorer, that's not from RapidFuzz
* fixed bug in ``token_ratio``
* fixed bug in result normalization causing zero division

[0.14.2] - 2020-12-31

Fixed
~~~~~
* utf8 usage in the copyright header caused problems with python2.7 on some platforms (see #70)

[0.14.1] - 2020-12-13
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Fixed
~~~~~
* when a custom processor like ``lambda s: s`` was used with any of the methods inside fuzz.* it always returned a score of 100. This release fixes this and adds a better test coverage to prevent this bug in the future.

[0.14.0] - 2020-12-09
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Added
~~~~~
* added hamming distance metric in the levenshtein module

[0.13.1] - 2020-11-17
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~
* process.extractOne  exits early when a score of 100 is found. This way the other strings do not have to be preprocessed anymore.

[0.13.0] - 2020-11-16
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Fixed
~~~~~
* string objects passed to scorers had to be strings even before preprocessing them. This was changed, so they only have to be strings after preprocessing similar to process.extract/process.extractOne

Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~
* process.extractOne is now implemented in C++ making it a lot faster
* When token_sort_ratio or partial_token_sort ratio is used inprocess.extractOne the words in the query are only sorted once to improve the runtime

Changed
~~~~~~~
* process.extractOne/process.extract do now return the index of the match, when the choices are a list.

Removed
~~~~~~~
* process.extractIndices got removed, since the indices are now already returned by process.extractOne/process.extract

[0.12.0] - 2020-09-30
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~
* partial_ratio is using the Levenshtein distance now, which is a lot faster. Since many of the other algorithms use partial_ratio, this helps to improve the overall performance

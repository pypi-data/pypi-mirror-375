# QUT Gradescope Auto Submitter

**One command to submit assignments to Gradescope. No more repetitive clicking.**

```bash
gradescope submit  # That's it.
```
---

## Why This Exists

As a QUT student, I was tired of:
- Clicking through Gradescope 50+ times per assignment during rapid iteration
- Waiting for pages to load when testing different approaches
- Losing focus switching between code editor and browser
- Manual file uploads and form submissions

This tool automates the entire submission process so you can focus on coding, not clicking.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
pip install qut-gradescope-autosubmitter && playwright install chromium

# One-time setup
gradescope init        # Create config file
gradescope credentials # Save QUT login

# Daily usage
gradescope submit      # Submit current assignment
```

That's it. No more manual submissions.

## How It Works

1. **Authenticates with QUT SSO** - Handles university login automatically
2. **Navigates to Gradescope** - Finds your course and assignment using smart matching
3. **Bundles your files** - Creates submission zip (respects .gitignore)
4. **Submits automatically** - Handles uploads and form submission
5. **Shows your grade** - Displays results when available

Everything runs locally using browser automation. No data leaves your machine except for the normal submission to Gradescope.

## Key Features

### Beautiful Terminal Interface
Modern CLI built with Rich - panels, progress bars, and custom themes that make terminal work enjoyable.

### Flexible Authentication
- **Session persistence** - Stay logged in between submissions (faster)
- **Multiple credential options** - Environment variables, .env files, or interactive prompts
- **Manual login mode** - Browser-based authentication for maximum security

### Smart Automation
- **Fuzzy matching** - Finds courses/assignments even with partial names
- **Automatic file detection** - Bundles relevant files intelligently
- **Git integration** - Optional hooks for submit-on-commit workflows
- **CI/CD ready** - GitHub Actions support for automated submissions

### Developer Experience
- **Cross-platform** - Windows, macOS, Linux support
- **Rich help system** - Beautiful documentation and error messages
- **System diagnostics** - Built-in troubleshooting tools
- **Customizable UI** - Adjust colors and behavior to your preference

## Installation

```bash
# Standard installation (PyPI)
pip install qut-gradescope-autosubmitter && playwright install chromium
```

## Basic Configuration

Create `gradescope.yml` in your project:
```yaml
course: cab201          # Your course code
assignment: assignment1 # Assignment name (fuzzy matched)
zip_name: submission.zip
bundle: ['*']           # Files to include (* = all, respects .gitignore)

# Optional settings
headless: true          # Run browser in background
notify_when_graded: true
```

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `gradescope submit` | Submit current assignment |
| `gradescope init` | Create config file with guided setup |
| `gradescope credentials` | Manage QUT login credentials |
| `gradescope doctor` | Check system requirements and troubleshoot |
| `gradescope --help` | Show all available commands |

## Automation Options

**Git Hooks** (submit on every commit):
```bash
gradescope hooks  # Interactive setup
```

**GitHub Actions** (cloud automation):
See [GitHub Actions Setup Guide](GITHUB_ACTIONS_SETUP.md) for complete configuration.

## Important Notes

**Current Status:**
- **PyPI Release** - Available on PyPI
- **Stable Features** - Core submission functionality is reliable and tested

**Usage Responsibility:**
- This tool is provided "as-is" for legitimate academic use
- Users are responsible for complying with QUT academic integrity policies
- Avoid excessive submissions that may trigger rate limiting on QUT SSO
- Use session persistence (default) to minimize login requests

**Limitations:**
- Requires QUT SSO access and Gradescope course enrollment
- May break if QUT or Gradescope significantly change their interfaces
- Some specialized assignment types may not be supported

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- QUT student account with Gradescope access
- Internet connection for initial setup and submissions

## Troubleshooting

**Common issues:**
- **Installation errors:** Try the separate dependency installation method above
- **Login failures:** Use `gradescope credentials` to reconfigure
- **Assignment not found:** Check course code and assignment name in config
- **Browser issues:** Run `gradescope doctor` for system diagnostics

For detailed troubleshooting, see the [Command Reference](docs/CLI_REFERENCE.md) or run `gradescope --help`.

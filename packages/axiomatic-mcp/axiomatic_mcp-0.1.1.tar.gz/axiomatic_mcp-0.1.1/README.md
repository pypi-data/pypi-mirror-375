## Getting an API Key

1. Fill the following [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfScbqRpgx3ZzkCmfVjKs8YogWDshOZW9p-LVXrWzIXjcHKrQ/viewform?usp=dialog) to request an Axiomatic_AI API key.
2. Once received, add the API key to your MCP client configuration as described in the Configuration section below.

## Configuration

Add the following settings to your MCP client configuration file or environment variables.

### API Key

All Axiomatic MCP servers require an API:

- `AXIOMATIC_API_KEY`: Your API key obtained after filling the request form.

### Telemetry

By default, we track tool usage to help us improve the services. You can optionally disable this feature:

- Set `DISABLE_TELEMETRY: "true"` in your MCP client configuration.

## Installation

### System requirements

- Python
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

### Individual MCP server installation

Installation instructions can be found for each specific server in their README.

### Install all servers

Copy the content of the [mcp-example.json](mcp-example.json) file into your AI client MCP server config json.

### Setting up MCP Servers in AI Clients

#### Claude Desktop

1. Open Claude Desktop settings
2. Navigate to Developer ‚Üí Edit MCP config
3. Add the server configuration(s) above
4. Restart Claude Desktop

#### Cursor

1. Open Cursor settings (Cmd/Ctrl + ,)
2. Search for "MCP"
3. Add the server configuration(s) to the MCP settings
4. Restart Cursor

#### Other MCP Clients

Refer to your client's documentation for MCP server configuration.

## Troubleshooting

### Server not appearing in Cursor

1. Restart Cursor after updating MCP settings
2. Check the Output panel (View ‚Üí Output ‚Üí MCP) for errors
3. Verify the command path is correct

### Multiple servers overwhelming the LLM

Install only the domain servers you need. Each server runs independently, so you can add/remove them as needed.

### API connection errors

1. Verify your API key is set correctly
2. Check internet connection

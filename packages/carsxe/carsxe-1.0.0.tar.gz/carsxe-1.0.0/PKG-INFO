2. **Install the CarsXE pip package:**

   Run this command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   pip install carsxe
   ```

3. **Import the CarsXE API into your code:**

   ```python
   from carsxe import CarsXE
   ```

4. **Initialize the API with your API key:**

   ```python
   API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
   carsxe = CarsXE(API_KEY)
   ```

5. **Use the various endpoint methods provided by the API to access the data you need.**

## Usage

```python
vin = 'WBAFR7C57CC811956'

try:
    vehicle = carsxe.specs({"vin": vin})
    print(vehicle["input"]["vin"])
except Exception as error:
    print(f"Error: {error}")
```

## 📚 Endpoints

The CarsXE API provides the following endpoint methods:

### `specs` – Decode VIN & get full vehicle specifications

**Required:**

- `vin`

**Optional:**

- `deepdata`
- `disableIntVINDecoding`

**Example:**

```python
vehicle = carsxe.specs({"vin": "WBAFR7C57CC811956"})
```

---

### `int_vin_decoder` – Decode VIN with worldwide support

**Required:**

- `vin`

**Optional:**

- None

**Example:**

```python
intvin = carsxe.int_vin_decoder({"vin": "WF0MXXGBWM8R43240"})
```

---

### `plate_decoder` – Decode license plate info (plate, country)

**Required:**

- `plate`
- `country` (always required except for US, where it is optional and defaults to 'US')

**Optional:**

- `state` (required for some countries, e.g. US, AU, CA)
- `district` (required for Pakistan)

> **Note:**
>
> - The `state` parameter is required only when applicable (for
>   specific countries such as US, AU, CA, etc.).
> - For Pakistan (`country='pk'`), both `state` and `district`
>   are required.

**Example:**

```python
decoded_plate = carsxe.plate_decoder({"plate": "7XER187", "state": "CA", "country": "US"})
```

---

### `market_value` – Estimate vehicle market value based on VIN

**Required:**

- `vin`

**Optional:**

- `state`

**Example:**

```python
marketvalue = carsxe.market_value({"vin": "WBAFR7C57CC811956"})
```

---

### `history` – Retrieve vehicle history

**Required:**

- `vin`

**Optional:**

- None

**Example:**

```python
history = carsxe.history({"vin": "WBAFR7C57CC811956"})
```

---

### `images` – Fetch images by make, model, year, trim

**Required:**

- `color`
- `transparent`
- `angle`
- `photoType`
- `size`
- `license`

**Example:**

```python

```

---

### `recalls` – Get safety recall data for a VIN

**Required:**

- `vin`

**Optional:**

- None

```python
recalls = carsxe.recalls({"vin": "1C4JJXR64PW696340"})
```

---

### `plate_image_recognition` – Read & decode plates from images

**Required:**

## Notes & Best Practices

- **Parameter requirements:** Each endpoint requires specific parameters—see the Required/Optional fields above.
- **Return values:** All responses are Python dictionaries for easy access and manipulation.
- **Error handling:** Use try/except blocks to gracefully handle API errors.
- **More info:** For advanced usage and full details, visit the [official API documentation](https://api.carsxe.com/docs).

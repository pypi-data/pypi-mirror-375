# Run Records and Database

AutoClean keeps a lightweight SQLite database inside your output directory. Each pipeline execution is assigned a ULID-based `run_id` and a run record that describes the processed file, the task used, and where outputs were written.

```json
{
  "run_id": "01HF...",
  "timestamp": "2025-04-02 10:15:00",
  "task": "RestingEyesOpen",
  "unprocessed_file": "/data/sub-01/eeg/rest.fif",
  "status": "completed",
  "success": true,
  "json_file": "sub-01_autoclean_metadata.json",
  "report_file": "sub-01_autoclean_report.pdf"
}
```

<Note>
Only metadata is stored in the database; the EEG data remains on disk in the run folder.
</Note>

The pipeline creates the record before processing and updates it as steps finish. Viewer tools query this database to list available runs, open associated files, and display quality metrics.

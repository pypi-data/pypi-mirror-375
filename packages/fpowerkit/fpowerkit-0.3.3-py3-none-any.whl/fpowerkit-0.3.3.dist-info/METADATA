# FPowerKit - A power distribution network calculation component

This is a package designed for power distribution network solving.

This package is affiliated to V2Sim, an open-aource microscopic V2G simulation platform in urban power and transportation network. If you are using the modified DistFlow model in this package, please cite the [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10970754)ï¼š

There are 3 modes for this package to work:

- Optimal power flow (OPF): Use cvxpy to solve the optimal power flow and determine the output of the generators.

- Power flow calculation: Use OpenDSS/GridCal/Inner Newton-Raphson method to solve the power flow.

- Hybrid: Use OPF to determine the initial value, and then use OpenDSS/GridCal/Inner Newton-Raphson to perform accurate calculation.

Since this package is still under development, the API is unstable and may be changed anytime.

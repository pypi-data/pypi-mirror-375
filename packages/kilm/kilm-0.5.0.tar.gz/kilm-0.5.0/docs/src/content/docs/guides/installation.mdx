KiLM (KiCad Library Manager) is a Python CLI tool that requires Python 3.9+ and KiCad 6.x+ to be installed and run at least once.

## System Requirements

- **Python 3.9 or newer**
- **KiCad 6.x or newer** (must be launched at least once to create configuration directories)
- **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux

<Aside type="note">
KiLM automatically detects KiCad installations and configuration paths across different platforms.

## Installation Methods

You can install KiLM using several methods:

### Method 1: Using pipx (Recommended)

[`pipx`](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) installs CLI tools in isolated environments, preventing dependency conflicts:

```bash
# Install pipx if you don't have it
python -m pip install --user pipx
python -m pipx ensurepath

# Install KiLM using pipx
pipx install kilm
```

### Method 2: Using uv (Fastest)

[`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is an extremely fast Python package installer:

```bash
# Install uv (Linux/macOS)
curl -sSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install KiLM using uv
uv pip install kilm
```

### Method 3: Using pip (Traditional)

Standard Python package installation:

```bash
pip install kilm
```

<Aside type="caution">
Using `pip` may cause dependency conflicts with other Python projects. Consider using `pipx` or `uv` for a cleaner installation.
</Aside>

### Method 4: From Source (Development)

For contributors or those wanting the latest development version:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/barisgit/kilm.git
cd kilm

# Install in editable mode with development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

See the [Development Setup](/community/development/) guide for more details.

## Verification

After installation, verify KiLM is installed correctly:

```bash
# Check version
kilm --version

# View available commands
kilm --help

# Check KiCad detection
kilm status
```

<Aside type="tip">
If `kilm status` shows "KiCad configuration not found," make sure you've launched KiCad at least once to create the configuration directories.

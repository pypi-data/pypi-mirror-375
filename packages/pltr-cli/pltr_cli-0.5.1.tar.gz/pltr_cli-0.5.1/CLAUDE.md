## Development tips

The basis of the SDK is https://github.com/palantir/foundry-platform-python . This is a
CLI that wraps around the SDK to give a CLI interface.

Use uv for dependency management.
Use uv to run python scripts.

## General Guidance

1. Be honest about what the SDK supports
2. Remove non-working commands rather than showing confusing errors
3. Focus on excellence in the features that do work
4. Provide clear guidance about the RID-based nature of the API

; PLC_auto_cure.pmc
;  This PLC runs PLC6 if the amplifier mode bit conflicts with the definition of the bit
;  as defined in this PLC. At time of writing (8/6/2010) sometimes the Geobrick sets the 
;  amp mode bit to servo for no reason, this PLC attempts to detect and fix the problem.
;  Delta Tau have promised a firmware update to fix this problem.
;  This PLC is only for use with Geobricks which have the new amplifier firmware
;  (look for a sticker saying flashed 09/09/09 or some other time in 09/09, if
;   you have firmware version 1.946 firmware or later you probably have the new 
;   amplifier firmware too). 
;  This PLC is derived from Trevors PLC7_Motion_Controls_Auto_Kill_or_Cure.pmc
; 
; NB Needs either BRICK_M_variables.pmc or PMAC_M_variables.pmc loaded (for M5006 defn.)
;
; Macros:
; PLC
;   PLC number
; NAXIS
;   The number of axis on the controller 1..16 (8 for a standard geobrick)
; SM1..SM16

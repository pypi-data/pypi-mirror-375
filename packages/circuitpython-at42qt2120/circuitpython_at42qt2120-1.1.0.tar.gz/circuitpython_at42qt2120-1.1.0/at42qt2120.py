    This function takes two integers representing the high and low bytes of
    a 16-bit integer and combines them to produce the resulting integer. Both
    bytes are masked to ensure only the least significant 8 bits of each are
    used. The result is also masked to fit within 16 bits.

    Args:
        high: The high byte of the 16-bit integer.
        low: The low byte of the 16-bit integer.

    Returns:
         The resulting 16-bit integer combined from the high and low bytes.

    Examples:
        Build a 16-bit integer from two 8-bit integers:
        >>> two_byte_int(0xFF, 0x00) == 0xFF00
        True

        Build a 16-bit integer from two incorrect 16-bit integers, losing

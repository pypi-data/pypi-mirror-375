Create multiple Fibery entities at once with specified fields.
Examples (note, that these databases are non-existent, use databases only from user's schema!):
Query: Create some features
Tool use:
{
    "database": "Product Management/Feature",
    "entities": [
        {
            "Product Management/Name": "New Feature 1",
            "Product Management/Description": "Description of the new feature 1",
            "workflow/state": "To Do" # notice how we use string literal for workflow field here
        },
        {
            "Product Management/Name": "New Feature 2",
            "Product Management/Description": "Description of the new feature 2",
            "workflow/state": "In Progress" # notice how we use string literal for workflow field here
        }
    ]
}
In case of successful execution, you will get links to created entities. Make sure to give the links to the user.

- ðŸ”§ **Easy to Use**: Simple API with sensible defaults and comprehensive configuration options
- ðŸ“Š **Multiple Formats**: Support for YOLO, COCO, and PASCAL VOC annotation formats
- ðŸš€ **High Performance**: GPU-accelerated rendering with Blender integration
- ðŸ§ª **Well Tested**: Comprehensive test suite with >90% code coverage
- ðŸ“š **Great Documentation**: Clear documentation with examples and API reference
- ðŸ”„ **CI/CD Ready**: Automated testing, building, and deployment pipeline

**What's Included:**
- Core library with generator classes
- Blender integration for 3D rendering
- Multiple annotation format exporters
- Command-line interface
- Configuration file support
- Comprehensive test suite
- Professional documentation
- Development tools and workflows

**Getting Started:**
```bash
pip install palletdatagenerator
```

```python
from palletdatagenerator import PalletDataGenerator
from palletdatagenerator.core.generator import GenerationConfig

# Create generator
generator = PalletDataGenerator()

# Configure generation
config = GenerationConfig(
    scene_type="single_pallet",
    num_frames=100,
    resolution=(640, 480),
    output_dir="./dataset",
    export_formats=["yolo", "coco"]
)

# Generate dataset
results = generator.generate_dataset(config)
```

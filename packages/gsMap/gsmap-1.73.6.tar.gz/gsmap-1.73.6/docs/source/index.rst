Welcome to gsMap's documentation!
===================================


Introduction
------------

``gsMap`` (genetically informed spatial mapping of cells for complex traits) integrates spatial transcriptomics (ST) data with genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics to map cells to human complex traits, including diseases, in a spatially resolved manner.


How to Cite
------------
If you use ``gsMap`` in your studies, please cite:

   Song, L., Chen, W., Hou, J., Guo, M. & Yang, J. `Spatially resolved mapping of cells associated with human complex traits <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08757-x>`_. Nature (2025).

Key Features
------------

- **Spatially-aware High-Resolution Trait Mapping**: Maps trait-associated cells at single-cell resolution, offering insights into their spatial distributions.
- **Spatial Region Identification**: Aggregates trait-cell association p-values into trait-tissue region association p-values, prioritizing tissue regions relevant to traits of interest.
- **Putative Causal Genes Identification**: Prioritizes putative causal genes by associating gene expression levels with cell-trait relevance.


Overview of ``gsMap`` Method
-----------------------------

``gsMap`` operates on a four-step process:

1. **Gene Specificity Assessment in Spatial Contexts**: To address technical noise and capture spatial correlations of gene expression profiles in ST data, ``gsMap`` leverages GNNs to identify homogeneous spots for each spot and estimates gene specificity scores by aggregating information from those homogeneous spots.
2. **Linking Gene Specificity to SNPs**: ``gsMap`` assigns gene specificity scores to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) based on their proximity to gene transcription start sites (TSS) and SNP-to-gene epigenetic linking maps.
3. **Spatial S-LDSC**: To estimate the relevance of spots to traits, ``gsMap`` associates stratified LD scores of individual spots with GWAS summary statistics using the S-LDSC framework.
4. **Spatial Region Identification**: To evaluate the association of a specific spatial region with traits, ``gsMap`` employs the Cauchy combination test to aggregate p-values from individual spots within that spatial region.

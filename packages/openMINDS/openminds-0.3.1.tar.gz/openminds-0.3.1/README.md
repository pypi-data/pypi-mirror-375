# openMINDS Python library

openMINDS Python is a small library to support the creation and use of openMINDS metadata models and schemas in your Python application, with import and export in JSON-LD format.

## Installation

```
pip install openMINDS
```

## Usage

``` python
from datetime import date
from openminds import Collection, IRI
import openminds.latest.core as omcore

# Create an empty metadata collection

collection = Collection()

# Create some metadata

mgm = omcore.Organization(
    full_name="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, Inc.",
    short_name="MGM",
    homepage=IRI("https://www.mgm.com")
)

stan = omcore.Person(
    given_name="Stan",
    family_name="Laurel",
    affiliations=omcore.Affiliation(member_of=mgm, start_date=date(1942, 1, 1))
)

ollie = omcore.Person(
    given_name="Oliver",
    family_name="Hardy",
    affiliations=omcore.Affiliation(member_of=mgm, start_date=date(1942, 1, 1))
)

# Add the metadata to the collection

collection.add(stan, ollie, mgm)

# Check the metadata are valid

failures = collection.validate()

# Save the collection in a single JSON-LD file

collection.save("my_collection.jsonld")

# Save each node in the collection to a separate file

collection.save("my_collection", individual_files=True)  # creates files within the 'my_collection' directory

# Load a collection from file
new_collection = Collection()
new_collection.load("my_collection.jsonld")
```

## Getting help

In case of questions about **openMINDS**, please contact us at support@openmetadatainitiative.org.
If you find a bug in the Python library or would like to suggest an enhancement or new feature,
please open a ticket in the [openMINDS Python library issue tracker](https://github.com/openMetadataInitiative/openMINDS_Python/issues).

If you identify a problem or would like to suggest changes to the openMINDS specification itself,

## Development

Contributions are welcome, please see our [contribution guidelines](https://openminds-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/shared/contribution_guidelines.html).

This repository has two main branches: `pipeline` and `main`.
The `pipeline` contains the code for building the Python package from the openMINDS schemas.
The build process is triggered by changes to the schemas, and runs as a GitHub action.
The resultant package is copied to the `main` branch, and at intervals is published on PyPI.

1.  **Structured Plan Representation & Management:**
    *   **Improvement:** Replace the simple `current_plan` string with a structured object (e.g., a list of Pydantic models or dictionaries). Each step could have `id`, `description`, `status` (planned, in_progress, done, failed), `dependencies` (list of action IDs it requires), `estimated_cost/time`, `assigned_tool` (optional), and `result_summary`.
    *   **Why:** Enables more complex planning, better progress tracking, easier plan modification/re-prioritization by the LLM, and direct integration with dependency checking. Makes replanning after errors more targeted. Allows visualization of the plan.
    *   **Integration:** Modify `_update_plan` to operate on this structure. The LLM prompt would ask it to generate/update *this structure*. Add new tools like `update_plan_step_status`, `add_plan_step`, `reprioritize_plan`.

2.  **Hierarchical Goal Decomposition & Tracking:**
    *   **Improvement:** Implement logic (potentially using an LLM call via a dedicated tool like `decompose_goal`) for the agent to break down the `top_level_goal` into smaller, actionable sub-goals. Store these sub-goals (maybe as `GOAL` type `thoughts` linked hierarchically or in a dedicated table) and track their status.
    *   **Why:** Handles complex, multi-stage projects more effectively. Allows the agent to focus on achievable intermediate steps while maintaining alignment with the overall objective. Improves clarity and progress reporting.
    *   **Integration:** The main loop would focus on the *current* active sub-goal. Context gathering (`_gather_context`) would prioritize information relevant to the current sub-goal. Planning (`_update_plan`) would focus on steps for the sub-goal.

3.  **Dependency-Aware Execution & Planning:**
    *   **Improvement:** Actively use the `dependencies` table and `get_action_dependencies` tool. Before starting an action, the loop *automatically* calls `get_action_dependencies(direction='upstream')`. If prerequisites exist, it checks their status (using `get_action_details` or similar). An action is only started if all 'requires' dependencies are 'completed'.
    *   **Why:** Prevents executing actions out of order or before necessary inputs are available. Makes the agent more reliable in complex workflows. Forces the LLM planner to consider prerequisites more explicitly.
    *   **Integration:** Add this check logic at the beginning of the `_execute_tool_call_internal` helper or within the main loop just before calling it.

4.  **Parallel Tool Execution:**
    *   **Improvement:** Enhance the planning phase/LLM decision to identify *independent* actions that can be executed concurrently. The loop would use `asyncio.gather` to run these tool calls in parallel.
    *   **Why:** Dramatically increases speed for tasks with non-sequential steps (e.g., fetching multiple independent data sources, running analyses on different data segments).
    *   **Integration:** Modify the plan structure to allow marking steps as parallelizable. `_execute_tool_call_internal` needs to be safe for concurrency. The main loop needs logic to identify parallelizable steps from the plan and use `asyncio.gather` to await them. Careful state management is needed.

5.  **Dynamic Tool Scoring & Selection:**
    *   **Improvement:** Instead of just relying on the LLM's choice, implement a scoring layer. When the LLM suggests a *type* of action (e.g., "search for recent files"), the loop could score available tools (e.g., `query_memories(type=file)`, `semantic_search`, `filesystem_list`) based on:
        *   Relevance of tool description to the current sub-goal/plan step (semantic search on tool descriptions).
        *   Historical success rate (from `agent_state.tool_usage_stats`).
        *   Recency of use.
        *   Potentially estimated cost/latency (if available).
    *   **Why:** Leads to more reliable and efficient tool use, potentially overriding a suboptimal LLM choice with a better-suited tool for the specific context. Adds robustness.
    *   **Integration:** Add a `_score_and_select_tool` method called after the LLM suggests an action type or a specific tool.

6.  **Workflow Patterns & Procedural Memory Integration:**
    *   **Improvement:** Use `consolidate_memories(consolidation_type='procedural')` strategically on sequences of successful `action_log` memories. Store the resulting procedure as a `PROCEDURAL` level memory. When planning, explicitly query (`query_memories(level='procedural', type='procedure')`) for relevant procedures that match the current sub-goal.
    *   **Why:** Allows the agent to learn and reuse successful workflows, improving efficiency and reliability over time. Moves beyond simple episodic recall to learned skills.
    *   **Integration:** Add logic to trigger procedural consolidation. Modify planning context gathering to include relevant procedures. Adapt LLM prompt to suggest using known procedures.

7.  **Goal-Directed Context Retrieval:**
    *   **Improvement:** Enhance `_gather_context`. Instead of fixed limits, dynamically fetch context based on the *current plan step* or *active sub-goal*. Use semantic search (`search_semantic_memories`) with the plan step/sub-goal description as the query to find the *most relevant* memories, potentially overriding less relevant "recent" or "important" ones.
    *   **Why:** Provides the LLM with more targeted and relevant information for its immediate decision, reducing prompt size and improving focus compared to generic context fetching.
    *   **Integration:** Modify `_gather_context` logic, potentially adding arguments to `get_workflow_context` or performing separate semantic searches within `_gather_context`.

8.  **Memory-Informed Confidence Weighting:**
    *   **Improvement:** When presenting context (especially memories) to the LLM, explicitly include the `confidence` score. Modify the system prompt to instruct the LLM to *weigh information based on confidence* and to be cautious when relying on low-confidence memories.
    *   **Why:** Makes the agent's reasoning more robust by incorporating uncertainty. Prevents over-reliance on potentially incorrect information stored previously.
    *   **Integration:** Modify `_gather_context` to ensure confidence scores are included. Update the system prompt in `_construct_agent_prompt`.

9.  **Active Context Summarization & Compression:**
    *   **Improvement:** Integrate context summarization *dynamically*. Before calling the main LLM, if the assembled context string exceeds a certain token threshold (e.g., 75% of the LLM's context window), trigger a *fast* LLM call (e.g., Haiku, Flash) using a specific tool (`summarize_context_block`) to summarize older parts of the context (e.g., less recent actions, less important memories). Replace the detailed older context with the summary.
    *   **Why:** Keeps the context window manageable for the primary LLM, reducing cost and potentially improving focus by compressing less critical information while preserving its essence. Faster than full conversation optimization.
    *   **Integration:** Add this check and summarization step within `_gather_context` or just before `_call_agent_llm`. Requires a dedicated summarization tool/prompt.

10. **Sophisticated Failure Analysis & Recovery Patterns:**
    *   **Improvement:** When `_execute_tool_call_internal` returns an error (`success: False`):
        *   Record a specific `ERROR` type memory containing details (`last_error_details`).
        *   Trigger `generate_reflection(reflection_type='gaps')` focusing on the failure.
        *   In the *next* LLM call, the prompt explicitly instructs the agent to analyze the error memory/reflection and propose *specific recovery steps* (e.g., retry with corrected args, use alternative tool, ask for help, abandon sub-goal).
        *   Store common error patterns and recovery strategies in `PROCEDURAL` memory over time.
    *   **Why:** Moves beyond simple retries or heuristic plan updates. Enables more intelligent debugging and adaptation based on the *nature* of the failure. Improves reliability.
    *   **Integration:** Enhance error handling logic after tool calls. Modify the system prompt to guide error analysis. Add logic to check for relevant recovery procedures in procedural memory during replanning.

11. **Speculative Execution / Branch Prediction:**
    *   **Improvement:** For decision points identified in the plan (e.g., "if X then Tool A, else Tool B"), the agent could speculatively *start* fetching context or even initiating low-cost/cached versions of *both* Tool A and Tool B in parallel while the condition X is being evaluated.
    *   **Why:** Reduces latency at decision points by having potential next steps already partially underway. Relies heavily on effective caching.
    *   **Integration:** Requires a more complex plan representation supporting conditional branches. The loop needs logic to identify these points and manage speculative `asyncio.Task`s, cancelling the unused branch once the condition resolves.

12. **Adaptive Meta-Cognition Triggers:**
    *   **Improvement:** Trigger reflection/consolidation based on dynamic metrics, not just counts/time. Examples:
        *   **Reflection:** Trigger if `consecutive_error_count > 1`, if progress on sub-goals stalls for N loops, if memory `confidence` drops significantly, or if conflicting memories are detected (`CONTRADICTS` links).
        *   **Consolidation:** Trigger if a high number of related `EPISODIC` memories accumulate around a specific topic (identified via tags or semantic clustering).
    *   **Why:** Makes meta-cognition more responsive to the agent's actual state and needs, rather than arbitrary intervals. Focuses learning/summarization efforts where they are most needed.
    *   **Integration:** Enhance the `_run_periodic_tasks` logic to check these conditions, potentially querying memory statistics or analyzing action history.

13. **Explicit Meta-Cognition Feedback Loop:**
    *   **Improvement:** After `generate_reflection` or `consolidate_memories` runs, *extract* key findings (e.g., identified gaps, new insights, generated plans/summaries) from the text result (potentially using another small LLM call for extraction). Store these extracted points as high-importance `FACT` or `INSIGHT` memories AND explicitly add them to the `last_meta_feedback` field in the `AgentState`.
    *   **Why:** Ensures the results of meta-cognition directly inform the *next* planning cycle, closing the learning loop more effectively than just storing the full text in memory.
    *   **Integration:** Add post-processing logic after calling reflection/consolidation tools within `_run_periodic_tasks`. Update the context gathering/prompting to use `last_meta_feedback`.

14. **Multi-Turn LLM Deliberation for Planning:**
    *   **Improvement:** For complex planning or replanning (especially after errors or significant feedback), engage the LLM in a short, internal multi-turn dialogue.
        *   Turn 1: Present context, ask for initial plan/options.
        *   Turn 2: Present Turn 1's output, ask LLM to critique it, refine it, or choose the best option.
        *   Turn 3: Finalize the plan based on deliberation.
    *   **Why:** Allows for more considered and potentially more robust planning by simulating self-correction and refinement *before* committing to action. Leverages the LLM's reasoning capabilities more deeply.
    *   **Integration:** Modify the `_call_agent_llm` interaction logic. Introduce state within the loop turn to handle these internal deliberation steps when `state.needs_replan` is high or the task complexity warrants it.

15. **Memory Linking Enhancement & Usage:**
    *   **Improvement:**
        *   **Auto-Linking Trigger:** Expand `_run_auto_linking` to trigger not just on `store_memory` but potentially after significant `record_thought` (e.g., type `insight`, `decision`) or `consolidate_memories`.
        *   **Link Traversal in Context:** Modify `_gather_context` to optionally traverse 1 level of `RELATED` or `SUPPORTS` links from important memories/thoughts to include closely related concepts, providing richer context.
        *   **LLM Link Creation Suggestion:** Modify the prompt to encourage the LLM to suggest explicit links between memories/thoughts using `create_memory_link` when it identifies strong relationships during its reasoning.
    *   **Why:** Creates a denser, more useful knowledge graph. Context becomes more associative. Leverages the LLM's ability to spot connections.
    *   **Integration:** Modify trigger points for `_run_auto_linking`. Add link traversal logic to `_gather_context`. Update the system prompt in `_construct_agent_prompt` to encourage link suggestions.

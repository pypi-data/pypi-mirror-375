# `mcp-simplelocalize`

A MCP (Model Context Protocol) server implementation for [SimpleLocalize](https://simplelocalize.io).

## Usage

### Install

1. [Install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

2. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GalvinGao/mcp-simplelocalize.git
```

3. Install dependencies

```bash
uv sync
```

4. Configure Cursor

You may wish to put this at `.cursor/mcp.json` under your project root, since SimpleLocalize API Key is specific to a single project.

Don't forget to add it to your `.gitignore` file to avoid exposing your API key.

```json
{
 "mcpServers": {
  "simplelocalize": {
   "command": "uv",
   "args": [
    "run",
    "--project",
    "/path/to/mcp-simplelocalize/",
    "/path/to/mcp-simplelocalize/main.py"
   ],
   "env": {
    "SIMPLELOCALIZE_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
   }
  }
 }
}
```

5. Describe your project localization requirements under `.cursorrules`. For example:

```markdown
## Translations
- Put all translations under the `default` namespace
- Language codes supported by this project: `en-US`, `ja-JP`, `ko-KR`, and `zh-Hant`.
- (any other conventions you want the LLM to follow, e.g. key naming style, etc. or just give it some examples would work well)
```

6. Done! Enjoy prompting something like "Localize this component and update it to SimpleLocalize".

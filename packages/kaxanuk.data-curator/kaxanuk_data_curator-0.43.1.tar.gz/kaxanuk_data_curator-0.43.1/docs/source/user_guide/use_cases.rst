Use Cases
====================

This section highlights a collection of practical examples built using the KaxaNuk Data Curator component library.

Each folder in the following repository contains an independent use case:

`KaxaNuk/Data-Curator-Use-Cases <https://github.com/KaxaNuk/Data-Curator-Use-Cases>`_

Before running any use case, make sure to provide a valid API key.
All examples require authentication and expect the API key to be set in a local ``Config/.env`` file within the corresponding folder.

These examples demonstrate common data workflows and provide a solid foundation for customizing the library to suit your specific goals.

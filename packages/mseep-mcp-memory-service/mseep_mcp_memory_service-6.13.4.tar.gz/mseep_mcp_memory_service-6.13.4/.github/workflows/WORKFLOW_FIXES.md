# Workflow Fixes Applied

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Cleanup Images Workflow (`cleanup-images.yml`)

**Issues:**
- Referenced non-existent workflows in `workflow_run` trigger
- Used incorrect action versions (`@v5` instead of `@v4`)
- Incorrect account type (`org` instead of `personal`)
- Missing error handling for optional steps
- No validation for Docker Hub credentials

**Fixes Applied:**
- Updated workflow references to match actual workflow names
- Downgraded action versions to stable versions (`@v4`, `@v1`)
- Changed account type to `personal` for personal GitHub account
- Added `continue-on-error: true` for optional cleanup steps
- Added credential validation and conditional Docker Hub cleanup
- Added informative messages when cleanup is skipped

### 2. Main Optimized Workflow (`main-optimized.yml`)

**Issues:**
- Complex matrix strategy with indirect secret access
- No handling for missing Docker Hub credentials
- Potential authentication failures for Docker registries

**Fixes Applied:**
- Simplified login steps with explicit registry conditions
- Added conditional Docker Hub login based on credential availability
- Added skip message when Docker Hub credentials are missing
- Improved error handling for registry authentication

## Changes Made

### cleanup-images.yml
```yaml
# Before
workflow_run:
  workflows: ["Release (Tags) - Optimized", "Main CI/CD Pipeline - Optimized"]

uses: actions/delete-package-versions@v5
account-type: org

# After
workflow_run:
  workflows: ["Main CI/CD Pipeline", "Docker Publish (Tags)", "Publish and Test (Tags)"]

uses: actions/delete-package-versions@v4
account-type: personal
continue-on-error: true
```

### main-optimized.yml
```yaml
# Before
username: ${{ matrix.username_secret == '_github_actor' && github.actor || secrets[matrix.username_secret] }}

# After
- name: Log in to Docker Hub
  if: matrix.registry == 'docker.io' && secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME && secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD
- name: Log in to GitHub Container Registry
  if: matrix.registry == 'ghcr.io'
```

## Safety Improvements

1. **Graceful Degradation**: Workflows now continue even if optional steps fail
2. **Credential Validation**: Proper checking for required secrets before use
3. **Clear Messaging**: Users are informed when steps are skipped
4. **Error Isolation**: Failures in one cleanup job don't affect others

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Manual Trigger Test**: Test cleanup workflow with dry-run mode
2. **Credential Scenarios**: Test with and without Docker Hub credentials
3. **Registry Cleanup**: Verify GHCR cleanup works independently
4. **Workflow Dependencies**: Ensure workflow triggers work correctly

## Expected Behavior

- **With Full Credentials**: Both GHCR and Docker Hub cleanup run
- **Without Docker Credentials**: Only GHCR cleanup runs, Docker Hub skipped
- **Action Failures**: Individual cleanup steps may fail but workflow continues
- **No Images to Clean**: Workflows complete successfully with no actions

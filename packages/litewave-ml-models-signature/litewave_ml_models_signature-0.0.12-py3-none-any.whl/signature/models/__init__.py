"""Neural network architectures for signature verification.

Available models and components:
- ResNet50Siamese: Siamese network with contrastive loss for signature verification
- SignatureViT: Vision Transformer with ArcFace for signature classification
- ArcFace: Angular margin loss implementation
- ContrastiveLoss: Contrastive loss for Siamese networks
- create_model: Factory function to create models based on configuration

All models support grayscale signature images and are optimized for signature verification.

0.28.1 - 2025-04-22
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fixed mistake README.md on last PyPI release.

0.28.0 - 2025-04-22
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- first PyPI release as dtools.splitends
- docstring changes
- pyproject.toml standardization

0.27.1.0 - 2025-04-22
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New repo dtools.splitends. Development only.

- first development release

0.25.0 - 2025-01-17
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First release under dtools.datastructures name.

0.22.1 - 2024-10-20
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Removed docs from repo. documentation
for all grscheller namespace projects maintained
`here <https://grscheller.github.io/grscheller-pypi-namespace-docs/>`_.

0.21.0 - 2024-08-20
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Got back to a state maintainer is happy with. Many dependencies needed updating
first.

0.20.5.1 - 2024-08-19
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Devel environment only. Datastructures coming back together.

- works with all the current versions of fp and circular-array
- preparing for PyPI 0.21.0 release

0.20.2.0 - 2024-08-03
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Devel environment only. Going down a typing rabbit hole

- updated to use grscheller.circular-array version 3.3.0 (3.2.3.0)
- updated to use grscheller.fp version 0.3.0 (0.2.3.0)
- removed grscheller.circular-array dependency from datastructures.SplitEnd
- still preparing for the 1.0.0 datastructures release

  - as I tighten up typing, I find I must do so for dependencies too
  - using `# type: ignore` is a band-aid, use `@overload` and `cast` instead
  - using `@overload` to "untype" optional parameters is the way to go
  - use `cast` only when you have knowledge beyond what the typechecker can know

0.19.0 - 2024-07-15
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- continuing to prepare for PyPI release 1.0.0
- cleaned up docstrings for a 1.0.0 release

0.18.0.0
~~~~~~~~

Beginning to prepare for PyPI release 1.0.0

- first devel version requiring circular-array 3.1.0
- still some design work to be done
- TODO: Verify flatMap family yields results in "natural" order

0.17.0.4
~~~~~~~~

 Start of effort to relax None restrictions

- have begun relaxing the requirement of not storing None as a value

  - completed for queues.py

- requires grscheller.circular-array >= 3.0.3.0
- perhaps next PyPI release will be v1.0.0 ???

0.16.0.0
~~~~~~~~

Preparing to support PEP 695 generics. Devel environment only.

- Requires Python >= 3.12
- preparing to support PEP 695 generics

  - will require Python 3.12
  - will not have to import typing for Python 3.12 and beyond
  - BUT... mypy does not support PEP 695 generics yet (Pyright does)

- bumped minimum Python version to >= 3.12 in pyproject.toml
- map methods mutating objects don't play nice with typing

  - map methods now return copies
  - THEREFORE: tests need to be completely overhauled

0.14.1.1
~~~~~~~~

Preparing to add TypeVars

- tests working with grscheller.circular-array >= 3.0.0, \<3.2

  - lots of mypy complaints
  - first version using TypeVars will be 0.15.0.0

0.14.0 - 2024-03-09

0.11.3.4
~~~~~~~~

Devel environment only. Finally decided to make next PyPI release Beta.

- Package structure mature and not subject to change beyond additions
- Will endeavor to keep top level & core module names the same
- API changes will be deprecated before removed

0.10.14.0 - 2023-12-09
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Devel environment only.

    - Pypy3 (7.3.13) using Python (3.10.13)
    - tests pass but are 4X slower
    - LSP almost useless due to more primitive typing module

0.10.7.0 - 2023-11-18

Devel environment only.

- Overhauled `__repr__` & `__str__` methods for all classes

  - tests that `ds == eval(repr(ds))` for all data structures ds in package

- Updated markdown overview documentation

0.10.1.0 - 2023-11-11
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Devel environment only.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- First Beta release of grscheller.datastructures on PyPI
- Infrastructure stable
- Existing datastructures only should need API additions
- Type annotations working extremely well
- Using Pdoc3 to generate documentation on GitHub

  - see https://grscheller.github.io/datastructures/

- All iterators conform to Python language "iterator protocol"
- Improved docstrings
- Future directions:

  - Develop some "typed" containers
  - Need to use this package in other projects to gain insight

0.8.6.0 - 2023-11-05
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Devel environment only.

- Finally got queue.py & stack.py inheritance sorted out
- LSP with Pyright working quite well
- Goals for next PyPI release:

  - combine methods

    - `tail` and `tailOr`
    - `cons` and `consOr`
    - `head` and `headOr`

0.8.3.0 - 2023-11-02
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Devel environment only.

- major API breaking change

  - `Dqueue` renamed `DQueue`

- tests now work

0.8.0.0 - 2023-10-28
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- API breaking changes

  - did not find everything returning self upon mutation

- Efforts for future directions

  - decided to use pdoc3 over sphinx to generate API documentation
  - need to resolve tension of package being Pythonic and Functional

0.7.5.0 - 2023-10-26
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Devel environment only.

- moved pytest test suite to root of the repo

  - src/grscheller/datastructures/tests -> tests/
  - seems to be the canonical location of a test suite

- instructions to run test suite in tests/__init__.py

0.7.4.0 - 2023-10-25
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- More mature
- More Pythonic
- Major API changes
- Still tagging it an Alpha release

0.7.2.0 - 2023-10-18
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- `Queue` & `Dqueue` no longer return `Maybe` objects

  - Neither store `None` as a value
  - Now safe to return `None` for non-existent values

    - like popping or peaking from an empty `queue` or `dqueue`

0.7.0.0 - 2023-10-16
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Devel environment only.

- added `Queue` data structure representing a FIFO queue
- renamed two `Dqueue` methods

  - `headR` -> `peakLastIn`
  - `headL` -> `peakNextOut`

- went ahead and removed `Stack` head method

  - fair since I still labeling releases as alpha releases
  - the API is still a work in progress

- updated README.md

  - foreshadowing making a distinction between

    - objects "sharing" their data -> FP methods return copies
    - objects "contain" their data -> FP methods mutate object

  - added info on class `Queue`

0.6.9.0 - 2023-10-09
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PyPI release.

- renamed core module to `iterlib` module

  - library just contained functions for manipulating iterators
  - TODO: use `mergeIters` as a guide for an iterator "zip" function

- class Stack better in alignment with:

  - Python lists

    - more natural for Stack to iterate backwards starting from head
    - removed Stack's `__getitem__` method
    - both pop and push/append from end

  - `Dqueue` which wraps a `Circle` instance

    - also `Dqueue` does not have a `__getitem__` method

  - `Circle` implements a circular array with a Python List

0.6.8.6 - 2023-10-08
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Devel environment only.

- 3 new methods for class `Circle` and `Dqueue`

  - `mapSelf`, `flatMapSelf`, `mergeMapSelf`

    - these correspond to `map`, `flatMap`, `mergeMap`
    - except they act on the class objects themselves, not new instances

- not worth the maintenance effort maintaining two version of `Dqueue`

  - one returning new instances
  - the other modifying the object in place

0.6.8.3 - 2023-10-06
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Devel environment only.

- class `Carray` renamed to `Circle`

  - implements a circular array based on a Python List
  - resizes itself as needed
  - will handle `None` values being pushed and popped from it
  - implemented in the grscheller.datastructures.circle module
  - O(1) pushing/popping to/from either end
  - O(1) length determination
  - O(1) indexing for setting and getting values.

- `Dqueue` implemented with `Circle` class instead of `list` directly
- Ensured that `None` is never pushed to `Stack` & `Dqueue` objects

0.6.3.2 - 2023-09-30
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Devel environment only.

- Improved comments and type annotations
- Removed isEmpty method from `Dqueue` class
- Both `Dqueue` & `Stack` objects evaluate true when non-empty
- Beginning preparations for the next PyPI release

  - Want to make next PyPI release a Beta release
  - Need to improve test suite first

0.6.2.0 - 2023-09-25
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Devel environment only. Removed `isEmpty` method from `Stack` class.

0.6.1.0 - 2023-09-25
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Devel environment only.

- Maybe `get()` and `getOrElse()` API changes
- getting a better handle on type annotation

  - work-in-progress
  - erroneous LSP error messages greatly reduced

0.5.2.1 - 2023-09-24
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- improved docstrings

0.2.2.2 - 2023-09-04
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PyPI release.

  - Python version (>=2.10 due to use of Python match statement)
  - Python standard libraries

- made pytest an optional [test] dependency
- added src/ as a top level directory as per

  - https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/
  - could not do the same for tests/ if end users are to have access

- pytest made a dependency

  - useful & less confusing to developers and end users

    - good for systems I have not tested on
    - prevents another pytest from being picked up from shell $PATH

      - using a different python version
      - giving "package not found" errors

    - for CI/CD pipelines requiring unit testing

0.2.0.2 - 2023-08-29

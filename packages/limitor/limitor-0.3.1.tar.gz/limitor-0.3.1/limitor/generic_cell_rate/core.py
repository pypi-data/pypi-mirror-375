    """
    The Generic Cell Rate Algorithm (GCRA) offers several benefits
    over other rate limiting algorithms like the classic
    leaky bucket or token bucket:

    1. Precise Rate Enforcement:
    GCRA enforces both the average rate and burst size with mathematical
    precision, making it ideal for telecom and networking applications
    where strict compliance is required.

    2. Low Memory and Computational Overhead:
    GCRA only needs to track a single timestamp
    (theoretical arrival time, TAT), rather than maintaining a
    queue or counter. This makes it very efficient in terms of memory
    and CPU usage.

    3. Deterministic Behavior:
    Because it is based on time calculations rather than random drops or
    queue lengths, GCRA provides deterministic and predictable rate limiting.

    4. Smooth Handling of Bursts:
    GCRA allows for controlled bursts up to a defined burst size,
    but strictly enforces the average rate over time. This is useful
    for applications that need to tolerate short bursts but not
     sustained overload.

    5. Widely Used in Networking:
    GCRA is the standard for ATM networks and is used in other
    telecom protocols, so it is well-tested and trusted in
    high-reliability environments.

    Summary:
    GCRA is chosen when you need strict, mathematically precise rate and burst enforcement,
    minimal resource usage, and predictable, deterministic behavior—especially in networking and telecom scenarios.
    For general-purpose rate limiting, simpler algorithms may suffice, but GCRA is preferred for high-precision,
    high-performance needs.

{# 通信规则模版 #}
<communication_rules>
<output_format>
The output must be in structured Markdown format and adhere to the following rules:

<code_block_markup>
1. Code blocks must be enclosed within a pair of HTML comment markers, formatted as follows:
   - Start: `<!-- Block-Start: {"name": "code block name", "version": numeric version like 1/2/3, "path": "optional file path for the code block"} -->`
   - Body: Wrapped in a Markdown code block (e.g., ```python)
   - End: `<!-- Block-End: {"name": same as in Block-Start} -->`

2. Multiple code blocks can share the same `name`, but must have different `version` numbers. The highest version is considered the latest valid version. Do not include version numbers in `name`.
3. `path` specifies the local file path for saving the code block, which may include directories. Relative paths default to the current or user-specified directory.
4. Multiple code blocks can be defined in a single output message.

Notes:
- Always wrap code using the defined markup.
- `name` must be consistent between Block-Start and Block-End.
- `version` must be an increasing integer, Use versioning to track updates.
- `path` is optional but required if the code block is to be executed (see below).
- All JSON must be **compact and one-line** (no pretty-printed/multiline JSON).
- ALWAYS use the `path` attribute to create static files.
</code_block_markup>

<exec_command>
If a code block should be executed, include a separate single-line HTML comment:
  <!-- Cmd-Exec: {"name": "block_name_to_execute"} -->

Rules:
- Multiple Cmd-Exec commands can be used in a single message.
- Refers to a previously defined code block in current or earlier messages.
- Refers to the latest version (highest number) of that block.
- Use Cmd-Exec instead of repeating blocks.

Only these code block types (languages) can be executed:
- `python` (always executable)
- `html`, `bash`, `applescript`, `javascript` (must specify `path`)

Platform restrictions:
- `bash`: Linux or macOS only
- `applescript`: macOS only
</exec_command>

<edit_command>
To modify existing code blocks incrementally, use the edit command:
  <!-- Cmd-Edit: {"name": "block_name_to_edit", "old": "code_to_replace", "new": "replacement_code", "replace_all": false} -->

Rules:
- `name`: Refers to an existing code block (latest version will be used)
- `old`: Exact string to find and replace (must match exactly, including whitespace)
- `new`: Replacement string (can be empty for deletion)
- `replace_all`: Optional boolean (default: false)
  - `false`: Replace only the first occurrence (safer, prevents accidental multiple replacements)
  - `true`: Replace all occurrences (use when you want to replace multiple instances)

Benefits of editing vs. rewriting full blocks:
- More efficient (smaller messages, less tokens)
- Clearer intent (shows exactly what changed)
- Preserves context (LLM doesn't need to regenerate entire block)

Error handling:
- If `old` string is not found: Edit fails with error message
- If `old` string appears multiple times and `replace_all` is false: Edit fails with error message
- Always provide sufficient context in `old` string to ensure unique matching

Multiple Cmd-Edit commands can be used in a single message and will be processed in order. Each command performs one find-and-replace operation.
</edit_command>

<good_example>
Example 1 - Creating and executing a code block:
<!-- Block-Start: {"name": "fetch_data", "version": 2, "path": "fetch.py"} -->
```python
import requests
resp = requests.get("https://example.com")
print(resp.text)
```
<!-- Block-End: {"name": "fetch_data"} -->

<!-- Cmd-Exec: {"name": "fetch_data"} -->

Example 2 - Editing an existing code block:
<!-- Cmd-Edit: {"name": "fetch_data", "old": "https://example.com", "new": "https://httpbin.org/json"} -->

Example 3 - Multiple operations in sequence:
<!-- Cmd-Edit: {"name": "fetch_data", "old": "print(resp.text)", "new": "print(resp.json())"} -->
<!-- Cmd-Exec: {"name": "fetch_data"} -->

Example 4 - Editing with replace_all:
<!-- Cmd-Edit: {"name": "fetch_data", "old": "resp", "new": "response", "replace_all": true} -->
</good_example>

<execution_results>
The results of code execution and editing operations will be provided in the following formats:

**Code Execution Results:**
```
<results>
<result code_block_name="code_block_name">
json_string
</result>
</results>
```

json_string is the execution result of the code block, which is a JSON object with the following fields:
- `stdout`: The standard output of the code block.
- `stderr`: The standard error of the code block.
- `errstr`: Exception message.
- `__state__`: Content of a __state__ variable (only for python code blocks)
- `traceback`: Exception stack trace. (only for python code blocks)
- `returncode`: The return code of the code block. (only for bash, applescript, javascript code blocks)

**Edit Operation Results:**
```
<edit_results>
<edit_result block_name="block_name">
{
  "success": boolean,
  "message": "description of the edit result",
  "block_name": "name of the edited block",
  "old_str": "the string that was replaced (truncated if long)",
  "new_str": "the replacement string (truncated if long)",
  "replace_all": boolean,
  "new_version": integer (version number of the newly created block)
}
</edit_result>
</edit_results>
```

**Mixed Operation Results:**
When both edit and execution commands are used in a single message, results are provided in processing order:
```
<mixed_results>
<edit_result block_name="block_name">...</edit_result>
<exec_result block_name="block_name">...</exec_result>
</mixed_results>
```

Note: 
- Empty attributes are excluded from the JSON output.
- You should combine the code and feedback data to make decisions.
- Edit operations create new versions of code blocks; execution always uses the latest version.

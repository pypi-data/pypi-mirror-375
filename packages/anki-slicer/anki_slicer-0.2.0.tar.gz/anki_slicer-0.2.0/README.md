🎧 Anki‑Slicer

Anki‑Slicer is a utility that lets you take an audio file (MP3, WAV, etc.) plus two SRT subtitles (original + translation), preview and flag sentences you want to learn, and then bulk‑export them into Anki flashcards — fully synchronized with the audio.

It’s designed for language learners who want to build rich, sentence‑level listening cards with audio + text, all in just a few clicks.
✨ Features

    ⏯️ Continuous / Auto‑Pause playback modes for sentence‑by‑sentence listening.
    🕹 Slider & Time Display to seek anywhere in the audio.
    🚩 Flag individual sentences or bulk‑flag all search matches.
    🔎 Search subtitles (original, translation, or both) and jump through results.
    🗂 Flagged list with checkboxes (select/deselect before exporting).
    📤 Export flagged items into Anki via AnkiConnect — creates cards automatically.
    🃏 Output deck: AnkiSlicer (rename inside Anki if you want multiple decks).

📦 Prerequisites

    Anki with the AnkiConnect add‑on installed and running.
    An audio file and two SRT files:
        Original transcript (same language as the audio).
        Translation of the original text.

💡 Tip: I personally use McWhisper (paid app) to generate accurate SRTs and export audio from YouTube or audio files. Other workflows are possible — e.g. extracting captions from YouTube, generating with Whisper/AI, etc.

🛠 Advanced Use

    Enhance your translation SRT before loading:
        Add explanations, grammar notes, transliterations (e.g. pinyin for Chinese).
        These extras appear on the answer side of the Anki card.
    Organize by subject: rename or split cards into different decks once in Anki.

SUBJECT: LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA S5678: Retraction of GW compact binary merger candidate

The LIGO Scientific Collaboration, the Virgo Collaboration, and the KAGRA
Collaboration report:

The trigger S5678 is no longer considered to be a candidate of interest. This
candidate was initially identified by one or more early-warning analyses by
matching partial signal templates to the data. Analysis of additional data up
to the putative merger time, with full signal templates, did not make a
significant detection, indicating that the initial candidate was likely due to
transient noise. **ADD EXPLANATION AS NECESSARY FOR RETRACTION**

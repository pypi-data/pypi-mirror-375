# Contributing to PyTECGg

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ðŸŽ‰  
Open source projects like this one thrive on community input.


## How to contribute

Whether you want to fix a bug, propose a new feature, improve the documentation, or just ask a question â€” you're welcome here!

Here are common ways to get involved:

- Report bugs
- Suggest enhancements
- Submit pull requests
- Improve documentation
- Review pull requests


## Getting started

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch  
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature_amazing_feature
    ```
3. Make your changes and format your code with [Black](https://github.com/psf/black)
    ```bash
    black .
    ```
4. Commit and push your changes to your fork
    ```bash
    git push origin feature_amazing_feature
    ```
5. Open a Pull Request

Please ensure that **each commit is atomic** (one feature/fix per commit) and includes a **clear message**. For bigger changes, consider writing a descriptive body.

## Code style

This project uses [**Black**](https://github.com/psf/black) as the code formatter: please run `black .` before pushing your code.

Some general conventions:

- Write readable, **modular** code.

- Add **comments** (if something isnâ€™t immediately obvious) **explaining the why**, not the how.

- Use meaningful variable names.

- Prefer **clarity** over cleverness.

## Testing

If your changes affect functionality, please include appropriate tests or describe how the changes were manually tested. This project uses [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest).

## Bug reports

If you find a bug, open an issue with the `bug` tag and:

- A clear title

- A short description of the bug

- Steps to reproduce (if possible)

- Expected vs. actual behavior

- Environment (Python version, OS, etc.)

## Feature suggestions

Want to propose something new? Great! Open an issue with the enhancement `tag` and describe:

- What the feature does

- Why it would be useful

- Any technical considerations or ideas for implementation

## Community

You can reach out by opening an issue for general discussion or suggestions.

Letâ€™s keep things respectful, constructive, and collaborative.

Thanks again! ðŸ’™

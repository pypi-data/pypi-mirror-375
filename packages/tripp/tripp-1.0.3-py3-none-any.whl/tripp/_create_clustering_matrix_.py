    """
    Function that generates clustering_matrix (feature matrix), where features
    include Z-score standardised pKa values (from pka_df) of selected 
    residues, together with (optionally) Z-score standardised buried ratios 
    (from buriedness_df) and inter-residue distances (calculated using the  
    calculate_charge_center_distances function). 
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    trajectory_file: str or dict
        When str, it is the path of the file containing the trajectory. The same
        formats allowed by MDAnalysis can be used. When dict, the clustering is performed using
        multiple trajectories specified in a dictionary, where trajectory names are
        used as key and file paths as values, e.g.: {'MD1' : 'file1 path', 'MD2' : 'file2 path', ...}.
        The same topology file is used for all trajectories.
    topology_file: str
        Path to the topology file. The same formats allowed by MDAnalysis can be used.
    pka_df: pd.DataFrame
        A DataFrame containing pKa values labelled by time, residue identifier, and
        trajectory name. This DataFrame is processed by the make_pka_or_buriendess_df function
        in the Clustering class.
    selections: list of str
        List of residues used for the clustering (selected with MDAnalysis selection syntax)
        For multi-chain systems, your topology and selection must include chain IDs.
    include_distances: bool
        If True, inter-residue distances (calculated between the charge centers) are used as
        additional features for the clustering alongside the pKa values.
    buriedness_df: pd.DataFrame
        A DataFrame containing buried ratio (buriedness) values labelled by time, residue identifier,
        and trajectory name. This DataFrame is processed by the make_pka_or_buriendess_df function
        in the Clustering class.
    include_buriedness: bool
        If True, buried ratio values will be included in the feature matrix.
        Default is False.
    Returns
    -------
    clustering_matrix: np.ndarray
        A 2D numpy array containing the normalized pKa values and distances.
    times: np.ndarray
        A 1D numpy array containing the times corresponding to the clustering data.
    frames: np.ndarray
        A 1D numpy array containing the frames corresponding to the clustering data.
    trajectory_names: np.ndarray
        A 1D numpy array containing the names of the trajectories corresponding to the clustering data.
    trajectory_dict: dict
        A dictionary where keys are trajectory names and values are MDAnalysis Universe objects.

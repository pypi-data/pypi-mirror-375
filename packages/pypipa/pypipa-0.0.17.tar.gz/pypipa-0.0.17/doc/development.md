## Roadmap

* **Data Collection**: Create a module for collecting data from various sources such as system logs, performance counters, monitoring tools, etc.
  * **Script Generation**: Create a module for generating performance data collection scripts to reduce noise generated by the Python runtime.
* **Data Parsing**: Create a module for parsing the collected raw data and converting it into a format that is easy to process and analyze.
* **Data Processing**: Create a module for further processing the parsed data, such as aligning data, segmenting data, etc.
  * **Calculate Performance Metrics**: Calculate various performance metrics based on the collected and processed data.
  * **Data Visualization**: Create a module for visualizing the processed data and performance metrics, allowing users to understand the performance data more intuitively.
* **Performance Analysis**: Create a module for in-depth analysis of performance data, such as bottleneck detection, performance prediction, etc.
* **Others**
  * **Cross-Platform Support**: Ensure the tool can run on multiple platforms such as x86_64, ARM, RISC-V, etc.
  * **Develop User Interface**: Develop a user interface to make the tool more user-friendly.
  * **Write Documentation**: Write detailed user documentation and API documentation to help users understand how to use the tool.
  * **Testing**: Write and execute test cases to ensure all parts of the tool work correctly.
  * **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Set up CI/CD workflows to automate the testing and deployment process.
  * **Performance Optimization**: Optimize the performance of the tool to ensure it maintains good performance when handling large amounts of data.

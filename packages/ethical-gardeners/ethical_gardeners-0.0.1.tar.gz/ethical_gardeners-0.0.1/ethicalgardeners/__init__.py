"""
Ethical Gardeners: A simulation environment for ethical reinforcement learning.

The Ethical Gardeners package implements a simulation environment where agents
(gardeners) interact with a grid world, planting and harvesting flowers while
considering ethical considerations. This environment is designed to study and
promote ethical behaviors in reinforcement learning algorithms.

Main Components:
-----------------

* :py:class:`.GridWorld`: The simulation grid representing the physical
  environment. It contains cells (:py:class:`.Cell`) of different types
  (:py:class:`.CellType`).
* :py:class:`.Agent`: The gardeners who act in the environment.
* :py:class:`.Flower`: Flowers that can be planted, grow, and reduce pollution.
* :py:func:`.create_action_enum`: Function that dynamically create an
  enumeration of actions for agents based on the number of flower types
  (:py:class:`._ActionEnum`).
* :py:class:`.ActionHandler`: Handles the execution of agent actions in the
  environment.
* :py:class:`.RewardFunctions`: Defines reward functions for agents based on
  their actions in the environment.
* :py:mod:`.observation`: Defines how agents perceive the environment.
* :py:class:`.MetricsCollector`: Tracks and exports various performance
  metrics.
* :py:mod:`.renderer`: Display the environment state to the user.
* :py:class:`.GardenersEnv`: The main environment class that integrates all
  components and provides the interface for interaction with RL agents.

Usage Examples:
-----------------
.. code-block:: python

    import hydra
    from ethicalgardeners import GardenersEnv, make_env
    from ethicalgardeners.main import run_simulation, _find_config_path


    @hydra.main(version_base=None, config_path=_find_config_path())
    def main(config):
        # Initialise the environment with the provided configuration
        env = make_env(config)
        env.reset()

        # Main loop for the environment
        run_simulation(env)

Launch
------
To run the simulation with the default configuration. After cloning the
project, at the project root, use the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    python ethicalgardeners/main.py --config-name config

After installing the package using pip, you can also run:

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m ethicalgardeners.main --config-name config

Configuration
-------------

The environment can be customized using a YAML configuration file with Hydra.
The default configuration file is located at `configs/config.yaml`. You can
override the default configuration parameters by modifying the YAML file or
using command line arguments when running the script:

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m ethicalgardeners.main grid=from_file observation=total
    metrics=full


This package is designed to be used with reinforcement learning frameworks
such as Gymnasium or pettingzoo and follows the API conventions of these
frameworks.

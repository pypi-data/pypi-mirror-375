//     ### Relationship Between Bounds and Metric Samples
//     Suppose a metric sample for active power has a lower-bound of -10,000 W,
//     and an upper-bound of 10,000 W. For the system to accept a charge
//     command, clients need to request current values within the bounds.

  MetricSampleVariant sample = 3;

  // List of bounds that apply to the metric sample.
  //
  // These bounds adapt in real-time to reflect the operating conditions at the
  // time of aggregation or derivation.
  //
  // #### Multiple Bounds
  //
  // In the case of certain components like batteries, multiple bounds might
  // exist. These multiple bounds collectively extend the range of allowable
  // values, effectively forming a union of all given bounds. In such cases,
  // the value of the metric must be within at least one of the bounds.
  // In accordance with the passive sign convention, bounds that limit discharge
  // would have negative numbers, while those limiting charge, such as for the
  // State of Power (SoP) metric, would be positive. Hence bounds can have
  // positive and negative values depending on the metric they represent.
  //
  // #### Example
  //
  // The diagram below illustrates the relationship between the bounds.
  // ```
  //      bound[0].lower                         bound[1].upper
  // <-------|============|------------------|============|--------->
  //                bound[0].upper      bound[1].lower
  // ```
  // ---- values here are disallowed and will be rejected
  // ==== values here are allowed and will be accepted

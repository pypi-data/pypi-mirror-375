Library of functions for iterating iterables.

- Concatenating and merging iterables
- Dropping and taking values from iterables
- Reducing and accumulating iterables
- Assumptions

  - iterables are not necessarily iterators
  - at all times iterator protocol is assumed to be followed

    - all iterators are assumed to be iterable
    - for all iterators ``foo`` we assume ``iter(foo) is foo``

This PyPI project is part of of the

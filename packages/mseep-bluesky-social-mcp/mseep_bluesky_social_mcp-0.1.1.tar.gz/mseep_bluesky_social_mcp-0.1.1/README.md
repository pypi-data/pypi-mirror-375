# Bluesky Social MCP

An MCP server for interacting with the Bluesky social network via the [atproto](https://github.com/MarshalX/atproto) client.

:wave: Leave an issue if you have any problems running this MCP. I should be able to push out fixes pretty quickly.

## Quick Start

Get your Bluesky app password at: https://bsky.app/settings/app-passwords

Add the following to your MCP config file (Note that the version is pinned):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bluesky-social": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "git+https://github.com/gwbischof/bluesky-social-mcp@v0.1", "bluesky-social-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "BLUESKY_IDENTIFIER": "your-handle.bsky.social",
        "BLUESKY_APP_PASSWORD": "your-app-password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
- For security reasons, I think its best to keep it pinned and manually change your config to update the version.

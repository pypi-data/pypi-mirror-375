# Tactical Agent Prompt: Phase 4A - Verification Test Case Design

**Agent Type**: general-purpose  
**Task**: Comprehensive analysis and test case design for faceting system verification  
**Expected Output**: Detailed test plan with verification decorator specifications

## Mission Objective

Analyze the current faceting implementation and existing examples to design a comprehensive verification testing strategy using the project's verification decorators. Create systematic test cases that provide objective, detailed analysis of faceting functionality rather than subjective visual assessment.

## Strategic Context

**Current Status**:
- âœ… **Faceting system simplified**: 80% code reduction with excellent quality standards
- âœ… **Functionality preserved**: Multi-variable faceting, style coordination, advanced targeting all working
- ðŸŽ¯ **Next Challenge**: Systematic verification that ALL capabilities work correctly across ALL use cases

**Key Problem**: Agents cannot reliably assess plot quality through visual inspection alone. The verification decorators in `src/dr_plotter/scripting/` provide objective analysis capabilities that solve this problem.

**Reference Documents**:
- `docs/projects/active/architectural_simplification/audit_reports/faceting_system_audit_report.md` - functionality requirements
- `src/dr_plotter/scripting/verif_decorators.py` - verification capabilities available
- `src/dr_plotter/scripting/plot_data_extractor.py` - detailed plot property extraction
- Existing faceting examples in `examples/` directory

## Research and Analysis Tasks

# Example specification format
@verify_plot(
    expected_legends=1,
    expected_channels={(0,0): ["color"], (0,1): ["color"], (1,0): ["color"], (1,1): ["color"]},
    verify_legend_consistency=True,
    subplot_descriptions={...}
)
def test_basic_multi_variable_faceting():
    # Clear test description
    # Expected behavior specification
    # Implementation approach
```

### Test Category 2: Advanced Feature Verification  
**Design Requirements**:
- **Advanced targeting**: Verify selective subplot population
- **Custom ordering**: Verify row_order, col_order, lines_order parameters

### Test Category 3: Integration and Compatibility Verification
**Design Requirements**:
- **FigureManager integration**: Verify plot_faceted method works with all configurations
- **Theme integration**: Verify consistent styling with different themes
- **Legend management**: Verify legend placement and coordination
- **Existing example compatibility**: Verify all existing examples still work identically

### Test Category 4: Edge Cases and Error Conditions
**Design Requirements**:
- **Single subplot scenarios**: When only one row or column specified
- **Missing data scenarios**: How empty data subsets are handled
- **Invalid configurations**: How errors are detected and reported
- **Boundary conditions**: Large grids, many series, complex targeting

### Test Category 5: Regression and Consistency
**Design Requirements**:
- **Visual consistency**: Colors, markers, legends consistent across subplots
- **Output quality**: Professional publication-ready appearance
- **Performance consistency**: No degradation with complex configurations
- **API compatibility**: Existing code continues working unchanged

- **Clear success criteria**: Objective, measurable outcomes for each test
- **Practical implementation guidance**: Specific decorator configurations and expected behaviors
- **Comprehensive coverage justification**: Rationale for why these test cases provide complete verification

## Critical Success Factors

**Systematic Coverage**: The test plan must cover ALL faceting capabilities, not just the obvious ones. Edge cases and integration scenarios are critical for complete verification.

**Objective Verification**: Every test must use verification decorators to provide specific, measurable success criteria rather than subjective visual assessment.

**Implementation Readiness**: The test specifications must be detailed enough that Phase 4B can implement and execute them systematically without additional design work.

**Quality Assurance**: The verification approach must be capable of detecting subtle issues like color consistency problems, legend coordination failures, or data partitioning errors.

---

**Key Implementation Principle**: Design tests that provide **confidence through objective measurement** rather than **hope through visual inspection**. The verification decorators are the key to transforming subjective "it looks right" into objective "it meets specification".

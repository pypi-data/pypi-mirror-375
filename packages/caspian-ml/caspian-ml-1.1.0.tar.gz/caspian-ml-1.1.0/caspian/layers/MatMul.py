class MatMul(Layer):
    '''
    A simple operation layer used to gain the matrix multiplication result of two arrays. Takes any 
    shape for both arrays, but the shapes must be compatible for the multiplication.

    On a backward pass, will return the appropriate gradients respectful to each of the inputs from
    the previous forward pass.

    Notes
    -----
    This layer can NOT be put into a standard Sequence layer, as it requires more than one input
    to function properly. A custom model which incorporates this layer must be created for it to
    function in a Sequence.

    This layer can also not be saved or loaded from a file, as it does not take any parameters.

# bedrock_server_manager/core/manager.py
"""
Defines the :class:`~.BedrockServerManager`, the application's central orchestrator.

This module provides the :class:`~.BedrockServerManager` class, which serves as
the primary high-level interface for managing application-wide aspects of the
Bedrock Server Manager. Unlike the :class:`~.core.bedrock_server.BedrockServer`
class that manages individual server instances, the :class:`~.BedrockServerManager`
handles operations that span across multiple servers or pertain to the application
as a whole.

Key responsibilities include:

    - Accessing and managing global application settings via the :class:`~.config.settings.Settings` object.
    - Discovering and validating existing Bedrock server installations.
    - Managing a central player database (``players.json``) by aggregating player
      information from individual server logs.
    - Controlling the lifecycle of the Web UI application, including its system service
      (Systemd on Linux, Windows Service on Windows).
    - Listing globally available content, such as ``.mcworld`` and addon files.
    - Checking and reporting system capabilities relevant to the application's features.

    """
    Manages global application settings, server discovery, and application-wide data.

    The :class:`~.BedrockServerManager` serves as the primary high-level interface
    for operations that affect the Bedrock Server Manager application globally or
    span multiple server instances. It is distinct from the
    :class:`~.core.bedrock_server.BedrockServer` class, which handles the specifics
    of individual server instances.

    Key Responsibilities:

        - Providing access to and management of global application settings through
          an aggregated :class:`~.config.settings.Settings` object.
        - Discovering server instances within the configured base directory and
          validating their installations.
        - Managing a central player database (``players.json``), including parsing
          player data and consolidating information from server logs.
        - Controlling the Web UI application's lifecycle, including managing its
          system service (Systemd for Linux, Windows Service for Windows).
        - Listing globally available content files (e.g., ``.mcworld`` templates,
          ``.mcaddon``/``.mcpack`` addons) from the content directory.
        - Checking and reporting on system capabilities (e.g., availability of
          task schedulers or service managers).

    An instance of this class is typically created once per application run. It
    initializes by loading or accepting a :class:`~.config.settings.Settings`
    instance and sets up paths based on this configuration. For operations that
    require interaction with a specific server (like scanning its logs), it will
    internally instantiate a :class:`~.core.bedrock_server.BedrockServer` object.

    Attributes:
        settings (:class:`~.config.settings.Settings`): The application's global
            settings object.
        capabilities (Dict[str, bool]): A dictionary indicating the availability
            of system features like 'scheduler' and 'service_manager'.
        _config_dir (str): Absolute path to the application's configuration directory.
        _app_data_dir (str): Absolute path to the application's data directory.
        _base_dir (Optional[str]): Absolute path to the base directory where server
            installations are stored. Based on ``settings['paths.servers']``.
        _content_dir (Optional[str]): Absolute path to the directory for global
            content like world templates and addons. Based on ``settings['paths.content']``.
        _expath (str): Path to the main BSM executable/script.
        _app_version (str): The application's version string.
        _WEB_SERVER_PID_FILENAME (str): Filename for the Web UI PID file.
        _WEB_SERVICE_SYSTEMD_NAME (str): Name for the Web UI systemd service.
        _WEB_SERVICE_WINDOWS_NAME_INTERNAL (str): Internal name for the Web UI Windows service.
        _WEB_SERVICE_WINDOWS_DISPLAY_NAME (str): Display name for the Web UI Windows service.

        Initializes the BedrockServerManager instance.

        This constructor sets up the manager by:

            1. Accepting an instance of the :class:`~.config.settings.Settings`
               class, which provides access to all application configurations.
            2. Performing a check for system capabilities (e.g., availability of
               ``crontab``, ``systemctl``) via :meth:`._check_system_capabilities`
               and logging warnings for missing dependencies via :meth:`._log_capability_warnings`.
            3. Caching essential paths (configuration directory, application data directory,
               servers base directory, content directory) and constants from the settings
               and application constants.
            4. Defining constants for Web UI process/service management (PID filename,
               service names for Systemd and Windows).
            5. Validating that critical directory paths (servers base directory, content
               directory) are configured in settings, raising a
               :class:`~.error.ConfigurationError` if not.

# ${\rm qCH_{eff}}$
${\rm qCH_{eff}}$ (/kju ʃɛf/) calculates effective Hamiltonians for quantum systems.
# Getting Started
 ${\rm qCH_{eff}}$ can be installed using `pip`:
```sh
pip install qcheff
 ```
NVIDIA's `cupy` library ([installation instructions](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/install.html#))  is required in order to use the GPU for computations. 


## Usage

```python
import qcheff

```

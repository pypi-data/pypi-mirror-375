## Adding your own model/method

If you wish to illustrate and run benchmarks with
your own **model** or **method**, then

- If it is a complex one, you may be better off using DAPPER
  merely as *inspiration* (but you can still
  [cite it](../#getting-started))
  rather than trying to squeeze everything into its templates.
- If it is relatively simple, however, you may well want to use DAPPER.
  In that case, read this:
    - [`mods`](mods)
    - [`da_methods`](da_methods)

Since the generality of DAPPER is
[limited](../#similar-projects)
it is quite likely you will also need to make changes to the DAPPER code itself.

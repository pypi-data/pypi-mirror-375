"""LangSmith-friendly export helpers.

Purpose
- Provide JSON-like payloads suitable for sending to LangSmith or similar tools.
- Avoid hard dependencies; callers supply their own client object.

Mapping
- ``serialize_run`` returns a dict with two keys:
  - ``run``: ``Run.model_dump(mode="json")`` â€” run metadata only.
  - ``events``: list of ``Event.model_dump(mode="json")`` for each event.
    When ``include_blobs=True``, the following keys may be inlined per event:
    - ``input_payload``: decoded JSON for ``input_ref`` blob if present/JSON.
    - ``output_payload``: decoded JSON for ``output_ref`` blob if present/JSON.

Caveats
- Redaction/encryption occur before persistence; exported payload reflects stored bytes.
- Hashes are computed over stored (possibly redacted/encrypted) content.
- Token chunks from messages aggregation are referenced via ``chunks_ref`` only.

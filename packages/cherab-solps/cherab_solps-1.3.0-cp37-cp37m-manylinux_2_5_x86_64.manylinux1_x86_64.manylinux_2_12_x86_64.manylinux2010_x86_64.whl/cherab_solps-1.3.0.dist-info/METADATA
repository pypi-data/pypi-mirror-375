        V. 1.1
        
        EUPL (c) the European Community 2007
        
        This European Union Public Licence (the "EUPL") applies to the Work or Software
        (as defined below) which is provided under the terms of this Licence. Any use
        of the Work, other than as authorised under this Licence is prohibited (to the
        extent such use is covered by a right of the copyright holder of the Work).
        
        The Original Work is provided under the terms of this Licence when the Licensor
        (as defined below) has placed the following notice immediately following the
        copyright notice for the Original Work:
        Licensed under the EUPL V.1.1 or has expressed by any other mean his
        willingness to license under the EUPL.
        
        1. Definitions
        
        In this Licence, the following terms have the following meaning:
        
        - The Licence: this Licence.
        
        - The Original Work or the Software: the software distributed and/or
          communicated by the Licensor under this Licence, available as Source Code and
          also as Executable Code as the case may be.
        
        - Derivative Works: the works or software that could be created by the
          Licensee, based upon the Original Work or modifications thereof. This Licence
          does not define the extent of modification or dependence on the Original Work
          required in order to classify a work as a Derivative Work; this extent is
          determined by copyright law applicable in the country mentioned in Article
          15.
        
        - The Work: the Original Work and/or its Derivative Works.
        
        - The Source Code: the human-readable form of the Work which is the most
          convenient for people to study and modify.
        
        - The Executable Code: any code which has generally been compiled and which is
          meant to be interpreted by a computer as a program.
        
        - The Licensor: the natural or legal person that distributes and/or
          communicates the Work under the Licence.
        
        - Contributor(s): any natural or legal person who modifies the Work under the
          Licence, or otherwise contributes to the creation of a Derivative Work.
        
        - The Licensee or "You": any natural or legal person who makes any usage of the
          Software under the terms of the Licence.
        
        - Distribution and/or Communication: any act of selling, giving, lending,
          renting, distributing, communicating, transmitting, or otherwise making
          available, on-line or off-line, copies of the Work or providing access to its
          essential functionalities at the disposal of any other natural or legal
          person.
        
        2. Scope of the rights granted by the Licence
        
        The Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
        sublicensable licence to do the following, for the duration of copyright vested
        in the Original Work:
        
        - use the Work in any circumstance and for all usage,
        - reproduce the Work,
        - modify the Original Work, and make Derivative Works based upon the Work,
        - communicate to the public, including the right to make available or display
          the Work or copies thereof to the public and perform publicly, as the case
          may be, the Work,
        - distribute the Work or copies thereof,
        - lend and rent the Work or copies thereof,
        - sub-license rights in the Work or copies thereof.
        
        Those rights can be exercised on any media, supports and formats, whether now
        known or later invented, as far as the applicable law permits so.
        
        In the countries where moral rights apply, the Licensor waives his right to
        exercise his moral right to the extent allowed by law in order to make
        effective the licence of the economic rights here above listed.
        
        The Licensor grants to the Licensee royalty-free, non exclusive usage rights to
        any patents held by the Licensor, to the extent necessary to make use of the
        rights granted on the Work under this Licence.
        
        3. Communication of the Source Code
        
        The Licensor may provide the Work either in its Source Code form, or as
        Executable Code. If the Work is provided as Executable Code, the Licensor
        provides in addition a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Work
        along with each copy of the Work that the Licensor distributes or indicates, in
        a notice following the copyright notice attached to the Work, a repository
        where the Source Code is easily and freely accessible for as long as the
        Licensor continues to distribute and/or communicate the Work.
        
        4. Limitations on copyright
        
        Nothing in this Licence is intended to deprive the Licensee of the benefits
        from any exception or limitation to the exclusive rights of the rights owners
        in the Original Work or Software, of the exhaustion of those rights or of other
        applicable limitations thereto.
        
        5. Obligations of the Licensee
        
        The grant of the rights mentioned above is subject to some restrictions and
        obligations imposed on the Licensee. Those obligations are the following:
        
        Attribution right: the Licensee shall keep intact all copyright, patent or
        trademarks notices and all notices that refer to the Licence and to the
        disclaimer of warranties. The Licensee must include a copy of such notices and
        a copy of the Licence with every copy of the Work he/she distributes and/or
        communicates. The Licensee must cause any Derivative Work to carry prominent
        notices stating that the Work has been modified and the date of modification.
        
        Copyleft clause: If the Licensee distributes and/or communicates copies of the
        Original Works or Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, this
        Distribution and/or Communication will be done under the terms of this Licence
        or of a later version of this Licence unless the Original Work is expressly
        distributed only under this version of the Licence. The Licensee (becoming
        Licensor) cannot offer or impose any additional terms or conditions on the Work
        or Derivative Work that alter or restrict the terms of the Licence.
        
        Compatibility clause: If the Licensee Distributes and/or Communicates
        Derivative Works or copies thereof based upon both the Original Work and
        another work licensed under a Compatible Licence, this Distribution and/or
        Communication can be done under the terms of this Compatible Licence. For the
        sake of this clause, "Compatible Licence" refers to the licences listed in the
        appendix attached to this Licence. Should the Licenseeâ€™s obligations under the
        Compatible Licence conflict with his/her obligations under this Licence, the
        obligations of the Compatible Licence shall prevail.
        
        Provision of Source Code: When distributing and/or communicating copies of the
        Work, the Licensee will provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code or
        indicate a repository where this Source will be easily and freely available for
        as long as the Licensee continues to distribute and/or communicate the Work.
        
        Legal Protection: This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade
        names, trademarks, service marks, or names of the Licensor, except as required
        for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
        reproducing the content of the copyright notice.
        
        6. Chain of Authorship
        
        The original Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original Work granted
        hereunder is owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the
        power and authority to grant the Licence.
        
        Each Contributor warrants that the copyright in the modifications he/she brings
        to the Work are owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the
        power and authority to grant the Licence.
        
        Each time You accept the Licence, the original Licensor and subsequent
        Contributors grant You a licence to their contributions to the Work, under the
        terms of this Licence.
        
        7. Disclaimer of Warranty
        
        The Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous
        contributors. It is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or
        "bugs" inherent to this type of software development.
        
        For the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an "as is"
        basis and without warranties of any kind concerning the Work, including without
        limitation merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence of
        defects or errors, accuracy, non-infringement of intellectual property rights
        other than copyright as stated in Article 6 of this Licence.
        
        This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a
        condition for the grant of any rights to the Work.
        
        8. Disclaimer of Liability
        
        Except in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to natural
        persons, the Licensor will in no event be liable for any direct or indirect,
        material or moral, damages of any kind, arising out of the Licence or of the
        use of the Work, including without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill,
        work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of data or any commercial
        damage, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such
        damage. However, the Licensor will be liable under statutory product liability
        laws as far such laws apply to the Work.
        
        9. Additional agreements
        
        While distributing the Original Work or Derivative Works, You may choose to
        conclude an additional agreement to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of
        support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or services
        consistent with this Licence. However, in accepting such obligations, You may
        act only on your own behalf and on your sole responsibility, not on behalf of
        the original Licensor or any other Contributor, and only if You agree to
        indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
        incurred by, or claims asserted against such Contributor by the fact You have
        accepted any such warranty or additional liability.
        
        10. Acceptance of the Licence
        
        The provisions of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on an icon "I agree"
        placed under the bottom of a window displaying the text of this Licence or by
        affirming consent in any other similar way, in accordance with the rules of
        applicable law. Clicking on that icon indicates your clear and irrevocable
        acceptance of this Licence and all of its terms and conditions.
        
        Similarly, you irrevocably accept this Licence and all of its terms and
        conditions by exercising any rights granted to You by Article 2 of this
        Licence, such as the use of the Work, the creation by You of a Derivative Work
        or the Distribution and/or Communication by You of the Work or copies thereof.
        
        11. Information to the public
        
        In case of any Distribution and/or Communication of the Work by means of
        electronic communication by You (for example, by offering to download the Work
        from a remote location) the distribution channel or media (for example, a
        website) must at least provide to the public the information requested by the
        applicable law regarding the Licensor, the Licence and the way it may be
        accessible, concluded, stored and reproduced by the Licensee.
        
        12. Termination of the Licence
        
        The Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon
        any breach by the Licensee of the terms of the Licence. Such a termination will
        not terminate the licences of any person who has received the Work from the
        Licensee under the Licence, provided such persons remain in full compliance
        with the Licence.
        
        13. Miscellaneous
        
        Without prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the complete
        agreement between the Parties as to the Work licensed hereunder.
        
        If any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
        law, this will not affect the validity or enforceability of the Licence as a
        whole. Such provision will be construed and/or reformed so as necessary to make
        it valid and enforceable.
        
        The European Commission may publish other linguistic versions and/or new
        versions of this Licence, so far this is required and reasonable, without
        reducing the scope of the rights granted by the Licence. New versions of the
        Licence will be published with a unique version number.
        
        All linguistic versions of this Licence, approved by the European Commission,
        have identical value. Parties can take advantage of the linguistic version of
        their choice.
        
        14. Jurisdiction
        
        Any litigation resulting from the interpretation of this License, arising
        between the European Commission, as a Licensor, and any Licensee, will be
        subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European
        Communities, as laid down in article 238 of the Treaty establishing the
        European Community.
        
        Any litigation arising between Parties, other than the European Commission, and
        resulting from the interpretation of this License, will be subject to the
        exclusive jurisdiction of the competent court where the Licensor resides or
        conducts its primary business.
        
        15. Applicable Law
        
        This Licence shall be governed by the law of the European Union country where
        the Licensor resides or has his registered office.
        
        This licence shall be governed by the Belgian law if:
        
        - a litigation arises between the European Commission, as a Licensor, and any
          Licensee;
        - the Licensor, other than the European Commission, has no residence or
          registered office inside a European Union country.

# Cherab SOLPS

Cherab add-on module for SOLPS simulations.

This module enables the creation of Cherab plasma objects from SOLPS simulations.
Several SOLPS output formats are supported.
Please see the examples in the [demos](demos) directory for an illustration of how to use the module.

## Installation

It is recommended to install Cherab in a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).
This will enable installation of packages without modifying the system Python installation, which is particularly important on shared systems.
To create a virtual environment, do the following:

```bash
python3 -m venv ~/venvs/cherab-venv
```

After the virtual environment is created, it can be activated by running:

```bash
source ~/venvs/cherab-venv/bin/activate
```

Once activated, cherab-solps and its dependencies can be installed with:

```bash
pip install cherab-solps
```

## Building from source

### Users

This module depends on the core Cherab framework.
Cherab core, and all of its dependencies, are available on PyPI and can be installed using `pip`.

Recent versions of `pip` which support [PEP 518](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/) will handle this automatically when you run `pip install cherab-solps` and a binary wheel is not available for your platform or Python version.

For older versions of `pip` you may need to manually install the build-time dependencies.
First, clone this repository, then do:

```bash
pip install -r <path-to-cherab-solps>/requirements.txt
pip install <path-to-cherab-solps>
```

This will pull in `cherab-core`, `raysect` `numpy` and other dependencies, then build and install the SOLPS module.

### Developers

Development should be done against the `development` branch of this repository, and any modifications submitted as pull requests to be merged back into `development`.

To install the package in editable mode, so that local changes are immediately visible without needing to reinstall, install the project dependencies into your development environment.
You should also enable auto rebuilds.
From the cherab-solps directory, run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install --no-build-isolation --config-settings=editable.rebuild=true -e .
```

If you are modifying Cython files these will then be automatically rebuilt and the modified versions used when Python is restarted.

Pure Python files will be automatically included in the distribution as long as they have been added to Git, but if you add any Cython files you will need to add (or modify) a CMakeLists.txt file in the same directory as the new files to ensure these modules are built and included in the distribution.
See the existing CMakeLists.txt files for examples of how to do this.
Also note that when adding new Cython files you will need to re-run the above `pip install` command to ensure these new modules will be available in the editable install.

#### Profiling

It is possible to turn on profiling and line tracing support in the Cython extensions, which may be useful for performance optimisation.
These features do incur a performance overhead so they are disabled by default.

To enable function-level profiling after installing the project in editable mode (see above), reinstall it with the following `pip` command:

```
pip install --no-build-isolation --config-settings=editable.rebuild=true --config-settings=cmake.define.profile=ON -e <path-to-cherab-solps>
```

To enable line-by-line profiling, use:

```
pip install --no-build-isolation --config-settings=editable.rebuild=true --config-settings=cmake.define.line-profile=ON -e <path-to-cherab-solps>
```

**Important:** the profile and line-profile settings will persist across subsequent (manual or automatic) rebuilds until they are turned off by running `pip install` with the corresponding definition set to `OFF`.

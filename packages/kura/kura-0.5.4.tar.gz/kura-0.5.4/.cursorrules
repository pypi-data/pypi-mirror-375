# Cursor Rules for Kura Project

## Development Workflow
- Always make pull requests for code changes
- Never push directly to main branch
- Create feature branches for new functionality
- Make sure all files are properly completed before committing
- Don't use `git add .` or `git add --all` - be selective about what you stage

## Writing Style
- Write at a 9th-grade reading level, always
- Use clear, simple language in documentation and comments
- Avoid technical jargon unless necessary

## Python Development
- Always use `uv` instead of `pip` for package management
- Follow existing code style and patterns in the project
- Add type hints to all new functions and methods
- Write docstrings for all public functions and classes

## Documentation
- Read related documents to match existing style when writing
- Keep documentation concise but complete
- Use examples to illustrate complex concepts

## Code Quality
- Run tests before submitting pull requests
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused on single responsibilities
- Add comments for complex logic

## Communication
- Don't use emojis in commit messages or documentation
- Be clear and direct in pull request descriptions
- Explain the "why" behind code changes, not just the "what"

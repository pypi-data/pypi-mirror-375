# Google Flights MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation that connects your Agents or LLMs to Google Flights data. Access flight information, find the cheapest options, filter by time restrictions, and get Google Flights' best recommendations!

## üåç Overview

This MCP server provides seamless access to Google Flights data, enabling your AI agents to:

- Retrieve **Comprehensive Flight Info**
- Find the **Cheapest Available Flights**
- Filter flights based on **Specific Time Constraints**
- Get Google Flights' recommended **Best Flights**

<br>

> **Note:** Currently, this tool only does one-ways (if you ask for a round-trip, it'll do two one-ways though!) as I built it as a fun pet project to learn about MCPs.
>
> If anyone actually finds this useful or wants me to, I can work on adding Round-Trip and Multi-City functionality!! Just raise a PR or [hit me up](https://sahit-personal-website.vercel.app/)!

## üé• Usage & Demo

Just follow the Quick Start to set this up for Claude Desktop, Cursor, or another MCP Client and just ask away to find out about your desired flight info!!

## ‚ö° Quick Start


### Claude Desktop

1. Make sure you have the latest [Claude for Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) downloaded!

2. Clone This Repo

3. Install `uv` to set up our Python Environment

   #### MacOS

   ```bash
   # Check if uv is already installed
   uv --version

   # If not installed
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

   #### Windows

   ```powershell
   # Check if uv is already installed
   uv --version

   # If not installed
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
   ```

   ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: After installation, you must restart your terminal for the `uv` command to get picked up!


4. Add this flights MCP Server to your Claude for Desktop config:

   #### MacOS

   - Navigate to the config file location via Terminal: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - OR if you have VSCode adn the Code alias, you can just create/edit using:

   ```bash
   code ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
   ```

   #### Windows

   - Navigate to the config file location via PowerShell: `%AppData%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
   - OR if you have VSCode adn the Code alias, you can just create/edit using:

   ```powershell
   code $env:AppData\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
   ```

   Note: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/config.json` is a different, unrelated file. Do not edit it.

5. Add this flights MCP Server in the `mcpServers` key:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "flights": {
         "command": "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/.local/bin/uv",
         "args": [
           "--directory",
           "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER",
           "run",
           "flights.py"
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   Make sure to modify the code to include the Absolute Path for `uv` for the `command` param and for the Absolute Path for the `args` param to this Repo.

    You may need to put the full path to the `uv` executable in the command field. You can get this by running:
    - `which uv` on MacOS/Linux
    - `where uv` on Windows

    Example:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "flights": {
         "command": "/Users/sahitmamidipaka/.local/bin/uv",
         "args": [
           "--directory",
           "/Users/sahitmamidipaka/Documents/Google-Flights-MCP-Server",
           "run",
           "flights.py"
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```





6. That's it! Open Claude for Desktop and you should see the little MCP Tools icon appear (make sure to re-open the app for updates to take place‚Äîyou'll need to do this whenever you change your `claude_desktop_config.json` file üòä)

### Cursor

1. Open Cursor & Go to Settings

2. Press the MCP Tab on the Left Panel

3. Add a new MCP Server (Choose one):

   #### Project Configuration

   - Create a `.cursor/mcp.json` file in your project directory
   - Ideal for tools specific to a single project

   #### Global Configuration

   - Create a `~/.cursor/mcp.json` file in your home directory
   - Makes MCP servers available across all Cursor workspaces

4. Attach the following configuration in the `mcp.json` file:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "flights": {
         "command": "uv",
         "args": [
           "--directory",
           "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER",
           "run",
           "flights.py"
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   Make sure to replace `/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER` with the actual path to this repo.

   You may need to put the full path to the `uv` executable in the command field. You can get this by running:
    - `which uv` on MacOS/Linux
    - `where uv` on Windows

   Example:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "flights": {
         "command": "/Users/sahitmamidipaka/.local/bin/uv",
         "args": [
           "--directory",
           "/Users/sahitmamidipaka/Documents/Google-Flights-MCP-Server",
           "run",
           "flights.py"
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

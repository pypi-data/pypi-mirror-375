# Performance and Scalability Enhancements Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of performance and scalability enhancements for the Agent Framework file management system, completed as part of task 8 in the enhanced file management specification.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Resource Manager (`agent_framework/resource_manager.py`)

The ResourceManager provides comprehensive resource management for file operations:

**Key Features:**
- **Concurrent Operation Limits**: Controls the maximum number of simultaneous file operations
- **Memory Usage Monitoring**: Tracks and limits memory consumption during file processing
- **Operation Queuing**: Manages a queue for operations when resource limits are reached
- **Performance Metrics**: Collects detailed metrics on operation timing and resource usage
- **Timeout Handling**: Automatically handles stuck operations with configurable timeouts

**Usage Example:**
```python
from agent_framework.resource_manager import ResourceManager, OperationType

manager = ResourceManager()
await manager.start()

async with manager.acquire_operation_slot(
    OperationType.UPLOAD,
    file_size_bytes=1024*1024,
    filename="large_file.pdf"
) as operation_id:
    # Perform file operation with resource management
    result = await process_file()

await manager.stop()
```

**Configuration Options:**
- `max_concurrent_operations`: Maximum simultaneous operations (default: 10)
- `max_memory_usage_mb`: Memory limit in MB (default: 500)
- `max_file_size_mb`: Maximum file size in MB (default: 100)
- `operation_timeout_seconds`: Timeout for operations (default: 300)

### 2. Performance Monitor (`agent_framework/performance_monitor.py`)

The PerformanceMonitor provides comprehensive performance tracking and alerting:

**Key Features:**
- **Operation Metrics**: Tracks timing, throughput, and success rates for different operation types
- **Storage Metrics**: Monitors storage usage, file counts, and space utilization
- **System Metrics**: Collects CPU, memory, and disk I/O statistics
- **Performance Alerts**: Automatic alerts for performance issues (high latency, low throughput, etc.)
- **Historical Data**: Maintains performance history for trend analysis
- **Metrics Export**: Export performance data to JSON files

**Monitored Metrics:**
- Operation duration and throughput
- Success/failure rates
- Memory and CPU usage
- Disk space utilization
- Storage backend performance

**Alert Types:**
- High latency operations
- Low throughput
- High error rates
- Resource exhaustion
- Low disk space

### 3. Progress Tracker (`agent_framework/progress_tracker.py`)

The ProgressTracker provides real-time progress feedback for long-running operations:

**Key Features:**
- **Real-time Progress Updates**: Track progress percentage and current step
- **Estimated Completion Time**: Calculate ETA based on current progress
- **Cancellation Support**: Allow users to cancel long-running operations
- **Step-by-step Tracking**: Track individual steps in multi-step operations
- **Progress Callbacks**: Register callbacks for progress updates

**Usage Example:**
```python
from agent_framework.progress_tracker import get_progress_manager

manager = get_progress_manager()
tracker = manager.create_tracker(
    operation_id="file_upload_123",
    operation_name="Uploading large file",
    total_steps=4
)

tracker.update_step("Validating file", 1)
tracker.update_step("Uploading content", 2)
tracker.update_step("Processing file", 3)
tracker.complete("Upload completed successfully")
```

### 4. Storage Optimizer (`agent_framework/storage_optimizer.py`)

The StorageOptimizer provides efficient storage space management:

**Key Features:**
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Remove old files based on age and storage limits
- **File Deduplication**: Identify and handle duplicate files
- **Compression**: Compress large files to save space
- **Storage Monitoring**: Monitor storage usage and alert on space issues
- **Optimization Scheduling**: Background optimization tasks

**Optimization Strategies:**
- Age-based file cleanup
- Storage size limit enforcement
- Duplicate file detection and removal
- Large file compression
- Storage space monitoring and alerts

### 5. Enhanced FileStorageManager Integration

The FileStorageManager has been enhanced to integrate all performance components:

**New Features:**
- **Automatic Resource Management**: All file operations use resource management
- **Performance Monitoring**: All operations are automatically monitored
- **Progress Tracking**: Long-running operations show progress
- **Storage Optimization**: Automatic storage optimization capabilities

**New Methods:**
```python
# Get comprehensive system metrics
metrics = await manager.get_system_metrics()

# Get performance summary
performance = await manager.get_performance_summary()

# Optimize storage
optimization_results = await manager.optimize_storage()

# Get storage optimization stats
storage_stats = await manager.get_storage_optimization_stats()

# Export performance metrics
await manager.export_performance_metrics("metrics.json")
```

## Enhanced File Processing Pipeline

The `process_file_inputs` function has been enhanced with:

**Performance Improvements:**
- Progress tracking for multi-file processing
- Resource management for concurrent file operations
- Performance monitoring for all file operations
- Cancellation support for long-running operations

**New Parameters:**
- `enable_progress_tracking`: Enable progress tracking (default: True)

**Enhanced Reporting:**
- Processing time metrics
- Resource usage information
- Progress updates during processing
- Detailed error reporting with performance context

## Configuration and Usage

### Initialization

```python
from agent_framework.file_system_management import FileStorageManager
from agent_framework.storage_optimizer import StorageOptimizationConfig

# Configure storage optimization
storage_config = StorageOptimizationConfig(
    max_file_age_days=30,
    max_storage_size_gb=10.0,
    enable_deduplication=True,
    enable_compression=True
)

# Initialize enhanced file storage manager
manager = FileStorageManager(
    enable_performance_monitoring=True,
    enable_resource_management=True,
    enable_storage_optimization=True,
    storage_optimization_config=storage_config
)
```

### Monitoring and Metrics

```python
# Get real-time system metrics
metrics = await manager.get_system_metrics()
print(f"Active operations: {metrics['resource_usage']['active_operations']}")
print(f"Memory usage: {metrics['resource_usage']['memory_usage_mb']:.1f}MB")

# Get performance summary
performance = await manager.get_performance_summary()
print(f"Total operations: {performance['summary']['total_operations']}")
print(f"Success rate: {performance['summary']['overall_success_rate_percent']:.1f}%")

# Check for performance alerts
if metrics.get('active_alerts', 0) > 0:
    print(f"⚠️ {metrics['active_alerts']} active performance alerts")
```

### Storage Optimization

```python
# Run storage optimization
results = await manager.optimize_storage()
print(f"Files processed: {results['files_processed']}")
print(f"Space saved: {results['space_saved_bytes'] / (1024*1024):.1f}MB")

# Get storage statistics
stats = await manager.get_storage_optimization_stats()
print(f"Total files: {stats['total_files']}")
print(f"Storage utilization: {stats['storage_utilization_percent']:.1f}%")
```

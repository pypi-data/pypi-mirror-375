The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [2025.3.0 - 2025-09-10]

### Larix improvements and bugfixes:
 - the FileList in Larix and many related Windows (to import data,
   etc), has a richer set of options with Right Mouse Button.  These
   also have "keyboard shortcuts" or "accelerators" (Ctrl- / Alt-
   keys) that do most actions to move and select groups. This allows
   much faster and easier manipulation of the list of datasets.

 - Saving Session Files is now more robust against certain classes of
   errors.  It will also happen in a background thread to avoid
   hanging Larix for large projects.

 - Loading Session Files now shows a more complete list of "non XAS
   Data groups" that can be imported.

 - on startup, Larix defines a "Session ID" (almost random) used for
   autosaving sessions, but now uses a separate "Session Name" that
   will be used for an explicitly Saved Session.  This will be set
   from the name of the first loaded dataset, but can be changed if
   using "Save Session As".

 - on startup, a Lock File using the Session ID will be created, and
   removed only when Larix is shutdown cleanly.

 - on startup, any existing Lock Files -- which might signal a Session
   that crashed or is running in another process -- and their
   corresponding auto-saved Session will be shown in a Dialog as
   available for Import or for having the Lock File removed.

 - the "Session Name" above will be shown in the Larix Title Bar.
 - Plot Windows will have Title Bars that include the Session Name and
   the Analysis Panel (or the Data Processing Window) that generated
   the plot.

 - Configuration of plotting options such as linewidths, colors,
   themes, and so forth is now both easier and more robust. Many of
   the plotting routines have had "hardcoded" values for such plot
   attributes removed.  The "plot" tab is "Edit Preferences" now has
   only a "Save Plot Configuration" to save the configuration of the
   current Plot Window #1 to ".larch/wxmplot.yaml".  This allows the
   configuration to be set from the Plot Window Configuration frame.
   This configuration file (which could be edited) will be loaded on
   startup and used for all plots.

 - The pre_edge range shown for XAS Normalization is more accurately
   displayed.

 - Very short pre-edge ranges better sets the backgroud form to
   "Constant".

 - More fixes so the EXAFS processing is re-done when groups are copied.
 - The XY Data Analysis Panel now allows settings which X and Y arrays
   to use for a Group.

 - Some simplifications in CurveFit Layout.
 - Fix for proper normalization of data in Pre-edge Panel.
 - Several fixes for showing Feffit Results.
 - A general attempt to have better and more consistent Fond sizes.


### xraylarch library:
 - better allow out-of-order constraint expressions in feffit Parameters
 - fixes to propagating uncertainties to Path Parameters
 - Make sure energy data is monotonically increasing in "rebin_xafs"
 - Fix reading edge_step in autobk.
 - many improvements to json-serialization for Session files, and
   avoiding some recursion errors and problems saving some numpy
   arrays. Add serialization of uncertainties ufloats.
 - improvements and simplification of saving session files.
 - load_session() now obeys the order of groups supplied in xasgroups argument.
 - many improvements to xafsplots functions to use `wmplot.yaml`
   theme, and to better use relative z-order values.
 - plotting chi(E) now better includes the edge-step.

    fitting can now be erased.

### Fixed

  - XAS Viewer: the merging of groups now works ;).
  - XAS Viewer: setting and energy shift for a group will copy that shift to
    other groups with the same energy reference. There is a preference setting
    to turn off this automated copying of energy shifts.

  - XAS Viewer: dialogs have generally better sizes.
  - XAS Viewer: fixes for plotting of Pre-edge peak fits.
  - XAS Viewer: improvements in Journal entries for some processed groups.
  - XAS Viewer: fixes for combining default and per-group configuration.

## [0.9.60 - 2022-05-23]

### Added

  - each Group of XAFS data will have a Journal - a list of entries with (label,
    value, timestamp) that will be used to record processing steps. The XAFS
    processing functions will write the parameters they were called with to this
    Journal. Users can add notes as Journal entries too.

  - XAS Viewer allows editing of program-wide Preferences, that set the default
    values and settings for the various analysis steps and program behavior.

  - In many windows showing analysis results, XAS Viewer supports setting the
    plot window number (1 through 9) so that more than one or two plot windows
    can be shown at a time.

  - Session-wide Project files (.larix extension) can now be saved and reloaded.
    These files contain essentially all the arrays for each Group of data,
    including Journals, processing results, and fit histories. The "processing
    workspaces" for pre-edge peak fitting, PCA, Linear Combinations,
    Regressions, and Feff fitting. These Session files can be saved/loaded by
    plain Python commands. When loading these into XAS Viewer, the fit histories
    and workspaces will be available. To allow better debugging and tracking of
    provenance, these Session Files include "configuration" data about the
    Session (python, larch version, etc) and a complete set of Larch commands
    for the session, though session commands are not "restored". The files are
    compressed and use a customized JSON encoding.

  - These Session files are now auto-saved by XAS Viewer periodically (every 15
    minutes of activity, by default, and rotated so that a small number (3, by
    default) of the most recent auto-saved files are kept. On startup, "restore
    the last session" is available (Ctrl-I).

### Fixed

  - XAS Viewer PCA fixed.
  - XAS Viewer now displays how each Group was created, for example
    "-log(i1/i0)".
  - XAS Viewer panels have more uniform energy range settings, relative to E0,
    per group.
  - XAS Viewer has more consistent coloring and font sizes.
  - XAS Viewer Quit dialog now lists the last saved Session file.
  - XAS Viewer now works even harder to keep _xasgroups correct.
  - pycifrw added as a dependency from conda-forge
  - copying parameters from one group to another is much improved.
  - rebinning of EXAFS data better avoids duplicate energies.
  - a few bugs with the handling of some CIFs were improved
  - Feff calculations now default to L3 edge for Z>= 60.
  - Python 3.10 is better supported, Python 3.7 seems to still work.

## [0.9.59 - 2022-04-01]

[Release announcement]()

### Added
 - Reading files from [FDMNES](http://fdmnes.neel.cnrs.fr/).
 - XAS Viewer allows reading in a reference spectrum from the same file as a spectrum.
 - XAS_Viewer better supports each spectrum having an "energy reference spectrum". This
    can be set on reading spectra, or afterwards.  Recalibratng energies can propogate
    calibrations to spectra that share a reference.
 - XAS Viewer better supports an "energy shift" for each spectrum -- this can be copied
    to other spectra or "undone" to go back to the original  (as read-in) data.
 - XAS Viewer: data can be deglitched while plotting in "k" space"
 - XAS Viewer: "flattened" spectra can be used for linear analysis in more places.
 - Example using Jupyter and Fe pre-edge peaks.

### Changed
 - XAS Viewer: the action of the "pin icon" for selecting points from a plot has now changed.
    Previously hitting the pin icon meant "use most recently clicked point on plot".  Now,
    hitting the pin icon starts a timer which will look for mouse clicks *after* hitting
    the pin icon:
       a) if there are new mouse clicks on the plot, wait at least 3 seconds, and return
          the most recent position.
       b) if there are no mouse clicks after 15 seconds, return the most recent position
           (even before clicking on the pin)


### Fixed
 - Reading columns names from one line header, and for files that announce as XDI but
    break XDI specs (say, by having >128 columns).
 - Better handling of CIFs with partial occupancy when generating feff.inp.
 - NLEG is set to 6 by default when generating feff.inp.
 - By default, hydrogen atoms are removed when generating feff.inp (XAS Viewer and cif2feff)
 - Athena project files with very long journals are better supported.
 - Some permission problems for installation of Applicatons on MacOS have been avoided.
 - "get current working directory" is now tested uniformly for permission errors.
 - MapViewer: more robust and flexible search for tomographic rotation axis.
 - Fix for spec/HDF5 files with broken "scan" link.
 - XRF Display spectral fiitting: faster, better guesss for parameter scales, and show
    filled eigenvectors (wxmplot 0.9.49)
 - MapViewer / XRF Display: much improved ADD ROIs, including pushing XRF ROIs added in
    XRF Display back to the list in Mapviewer.
 - MapViewer: The order of ROIs added is now preserved, including for work arrays and
    Abundances from XRF analysis.


### Removed
 - Plugins are now completely removed
 - 32-bit  Windows is no longer supported: libraries and executables have been removed.
 - Cromer-Libermann is more deprecated and hidden (but not completely gone, yet)

### Changed
 - the plot selection choice in the XAS normalization panel for "one group" and "selected groups" are no longer reset each time a data set is selected.

### Added
 - A reference spectrum can now be set for any XAFS spectrum.
 - For linear combination fitting, a single energy shift can be varied during the fit, shifting the unknown data to match the combination of a (presumably aligned) set of standards.
 - For pre-edge peak fitting and Feff Path fitting, entries in the "fit history" can have user-specified labels which can be more meaningful than the default "Fit #1", "Fit #2", etc.
 - testing is now done only with Github Actions, not with the appveyor service.

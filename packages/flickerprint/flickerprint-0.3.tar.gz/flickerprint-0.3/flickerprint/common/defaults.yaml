## Configuration file for the experiment file

## The default values are designed to give to reasonable behaviour

## Note that any lines starting with a '#' character are ignored.
## By convention any lines starting with '##' are for comments and a single '#'
## is used to disable the option (and falling back to default behaviour),
## but may be re-enabled by removing this the '#' character.

## Parameters used in automating the workflow, particularly in snakemake.
## These are not required if the scripts are being run manually, but this is
## not recommended.
workflow:
  ## Location of the microscopy files
  image_dir: "default_images"

  ## Glob pattern for the microscopy files inside the image directory,
  ## if this not provided then fall back to a set of sensible default values.
  image_regex: "*.ims"

  ## User name
  ##   Human readable name for the experiment
  ##   This is used in organisation and plotting
  ##   Experiments with the same name will be combined by the plotting routines.
  experiment_name: "experiment_name"

image_processing:
  ## The width of one pixel in microns
  ##    IMPORTANT: The program will try to extract this value from
  ##    the microscope file's metadata. The value here is only used
  ##    if the metadata is missing or incomplete. This is especially
  ##    important for bare image files (ie. .tiff). You will recieve
  ##    a warning if this value is used.
  pixel_size: 0.1408

  ## Method for drawing the boundary, these are:
  ##   gradient: Find the maximum of the directional gradient
  ##   intensity: Find the point at which the intensity crosses a given threshold
  method: gradient

  ## Smoothing
  ##   Noise in the image will often will disrupt the boundary detection
  ##   we can therefore apply a smoothing to the image to reduce this effect.
  ##   This is given as an float of the Gaussian sigma width.
  smoothing: 1.5

  ## Minimum granule radius
  ##  Reject granules with a radius smaller than this value.
  ##  Given in micrometers
  granule_minimum_radius: 0.3

  ## Maximum granule radius
  ##  Reject granules with a radius larger than this value.
  ##  Given in micrometers
  granule_maximum_radius: 3.0

  ## Minimum intensity of a granule relative to the maximum intensity, 
  ##   used in the detection algorithm.
  ##   This is particularly important in transfected cells, where the 
  ##   intensity may vary greatly between cells.
  granule_minimum_intensity: 0.1

  ## Intensity threshold for the flood fill
  ## not used with method:intensity
  fill_threshold: 0.6

  ## Condensate Tracking Threshold
  ##  The value is given in pixels, and is used to link granules between frames.
  ##  The closest granule in the previous frame must be within this distance
  ##  to be considered the same granule.
  ##  Do not change this value unless you are having issues with condensate tracking.
  tracking_threshold: 15

  ## Produce images of the granules, showing their position in the frame and their boundaries.
  ##  True: Save an image of the granules for every 100 frames, with their center and boundary
  ##  marked (results in lots of files which require significant additional processing)
  ##  False: Do not save images of the granules
  granule_images: False

spectrum_fitting:
  ## Experimental spectrum used to fit the theoretical model
  ##   direct: Use the magnitude squared directly
  ##   corrected: Use the standard deviation of the magnitudes
  ## These terms are identical for a spherical granules
  experimental_spectrum: corrected

  ## Fitting orders
  ##   Number of orders to use in the spectrum fitting
  fitting_orders: 15

  ## Temperature
  ##  The temperature which the experiments were conducted at (Degrees Celcius)
  temperature: 37

  ## Plot Spectra and Heatmaps
  ##  True: Save a plot of the fluctuation spectra and heatmaps for each granule (large files which require significant additional processing)
  ##  False: Do not plot the spectra and heatmaps for each granule (results are stored in aggregate_fittings.h5 only)
  plot_spectra_and_heatmaps: False

## Parameters used in automated plotting
plotting:
  latex: True

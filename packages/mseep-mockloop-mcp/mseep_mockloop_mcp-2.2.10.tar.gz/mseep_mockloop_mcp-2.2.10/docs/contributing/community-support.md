```markdown
**Bug Description**
MockLoop MCP fails to generate mock server from OpenAPI spec with circular references.

**To Reproduce**
1. Install mockloop-mcp via pip
2. Use the attached OpenAPI spec (circular-refs.yaml)
3. Run: `generate_mock_api` tool with the spec
4. Error occurs during parsing

**Expected Behavior**
Should generate mock server or provide clear error about unsupported circular references.

**Environment**
- MockLoop MCP Version: 2.1.0
- Python Version: 3.11.5
- OS: Ubuntu 22.04
- Installation: PyPI

**Additional Context**
Spec works fine with other tools like Swagger UI.
```

  - Version conflicts
  - Dependency issues

## Feature Requests

### üí° Suggesting Features

We welcome feature suggestions! Please:

1. **Check existing requests**: Search existing issues first
2. **Use the template**: Follow our feature request template
3. **Provide context**: Explain the use case and problem
4. **Consider alternatives**: Mention any workarounds you've tried

#### Good Feature Request Example
```markdown
**Problem Statement**
As a developer using MockLoop MCP with GraphQL APIs, I need support for GraphQL schema parsing to generate mock servers.

**Proposed Solution**
Add GraphQL schema support to the `generate_mock_api` tool, similar to existing OpenAPI support.

**Use Case**
- Parse GraphQL schema files (.graphql, .gql)
- Generate mock resolvers for queries and mutations
- Support for custom scalar types
- Integration with existing admin UI

**Alternatives Considered**
- Converting GraphQL to OpenAPI (complex and lossy)
- Using separate GraphQL mocking tools (breaks workflow)

**Additional Context**
GraphQL is increasingly popular, and this would make MockLoop MCP more versatile.
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Installation and Setup

**Q: How do I install MockLoop MCP?**
A: Use `pip install mockloop-mcp`. See our [Installation Guide](../getting-started/installation.md) for details.

**Q: Which Python versions are supported?**
A: Python 3.9+ is supported, with 3.10+ recommended.

**Q: Can I use MockLoop MCP without Docker?**
A: Yes, Docker is only required for containerized mock servers. You can run mocks directly with Python.

### Usage

**Q: What API specification formats are supported?**
A: Currently OpenAPI v2 (Swagger) and v3 (JSON/YAML). GraphQL and other formats are planned.

**Q: How do I update mock responses dynamically?**
A: Use the `manage_mock_data` tool to update responses without restarting the server.

**Q: Can I use MockLoop MCP in production?**
A: MockLoop MCP is designed for development and testing. For production use, consider proper API gateways.

### Troubleshooting

**Q: MockLoop MCP won't start with my MCP client**
A: Check the configuration path and ensure the command is correct. See [Quick Start](../getting-started/quick-start.md) for examples.

**Q: I'm getting import errors after installation**
A: Verify your Python environment and try reinstalling: `pip uninstall mockloop-mcp && pip install mockloop-mcp`

**Q: The generated mock server returns empty responses**
A: Check your OpenAPI specification for examples or default values. MockLoop MCP uses these for realistic responses.

## Usage
 - To use this template, click the green `Use this template` button and `Create new repository`.
 - After github initially creates the new repository, please wait an extra minute for the initialization scripts to finish organizing the repo.
 - To enable the automatic semantic version increments: in the repository go to `Settings` and `Collaborators and teams`. Click the green `Add people` button. Add `svc-aindscicomp` as an admin. Modify the file in `.github/workflows/tag_and_publish.yml` and remove the if statement in line 65. The semantic version will now be incremented every time a code is committed into the main branch.
 - To publish to PyPI, enable semantic versioning and uncomment the publish block in `.github/workflows/tag_and_publish.yml`. The code will now be published to PyPI every time the code is committed into the main branch.
 - The `.github/workflows/test_and_lint.yml` file will run automated tests and style checks every time a Pull Request is opened. If the checks are undesired, the `test_and_lint.yml` can be deleted. The strictness of the code coverage level, etc., can be modified by altering the configurations in the `pyproject.toml` file and the `.flake8` file.
 - Please make any necessary updates to the README.md and CITATION.cff files

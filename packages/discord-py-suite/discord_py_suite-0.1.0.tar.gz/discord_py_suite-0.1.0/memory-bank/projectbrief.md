# Discord-Py-Suite Project Brief

## Project Overview
Discord-Py-Suite is a production-ready FastMCP server that provides comprehensive comprehensive Discord API integration with 56 modular tools across 8 categories specifically designed for AI assistants and automation platforms. (Phase 2: Growth from 31 tools to 56 tools accomplished)

## Core Purpose
- Deliver a robust, modular FastMCP implementation for Discord operations
- Enable seamless integration of Discord functionality into AI-powered workflows
- Provide production-grade tooling with comprehensive error handling and type safety

## Key Objectives
1. Maintain 56 modular Discord tools covering basic, messaging, users, channels, moderation, roles, voice, and webhook operations
2. Ensure modular architecture with single-responsibility modules under 400 lines
3. Implement consistent API response formats and error handling
4. Support multiple transports (STDIO, HTTP, SSE) for flexible deployment
5. Follow best practices with strong typing, static analysis, and automated testing

## Scope Boundaries
- Focus on server-side FastMCP implementation rather than client-side integrations
- Implement Discord-specific tools only, avoiding generic framework extensions
- Maintain Python 3.11+ compatibility with modern typing and async patterns
- Keep modular structure to enable easy expansion of additional tool categories

## Success Criteria
- All core tools functional and well-tested across different Discord server environments
- Performance optimized for real-time operations with proper rate limiting
- Documentation comprehensive enough for easy onboarding and maintenance
- Architecture extensible to support forum, audit, and emoji tools in Phase 3

## Architectural Constraints
- Use FastMCP 2.12.0+ framework exclusively
- Implement modular tool registration pattern with decorator-based approach
- Ensure Pydantic models for configuration and data validation
- Maintain clean separation between core server logic and tool implementations

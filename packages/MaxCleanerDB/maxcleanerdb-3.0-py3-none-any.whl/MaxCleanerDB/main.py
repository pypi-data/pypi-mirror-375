    Writes a list of data to the main file and its backups after validating structure.
    To reset (clear) the file, pass an empty list `[]` as `write_list`.
    This is useful when you want to wipe data clean or intentionally restart
    due to a structure mismatch.

    This function:
        - Normalizes the file name and ensures the target folder exists.
        - Validates that the new `write_list` matches the structure of the existing file (if any).
        - Serializes and writes the data to all backup versions of the file.

    Args:
        txt_name (str): Base name of the file to write to.
        write_list (list): List of rows to write. Must match structure of existing file if not empty.

    Raises:
        ValueError:
            - If `write_list` is non-empty and its row structure doesn't match the current file.
            - Example: writing a 2D list when the file is 1D, or inconsistent row lengths.

## Overview

Eka Care's Model Context Protocol (MCP) server facilitates interaction with medical knowledge-bases specifically curated for the Indian healthcare context. While advanced models from Claude, OpenAI, and others can perform adequately in medical contexts, their responses often lack grounding in factual information and published references. Additionally, India faces a significant challenge with the absence of centralized repositories for branded medications in the public domain.

The Eka MCP Server addresses these challenges by providing structured access to curated knowledge-bases through specialized tools:

* **Indian Branded Drug Search**: Enables lookup across 500,000+ branded drugs available in India, returning comprehensive metadata including generic composition and manufacturer information to enhance LLM responses.
* **Indian Treatment Protocol Search**: Provides contextual access to over 180 treatment protocol documents published by authoritative Indian healthcare institutions such as ICMR and RSSDI.


Key Benefits:
* 🩺 Medical Accuracy: Grounds AI responses in verified healthcare information
* 🔄 Seamless Workflow: Provides critical information without requiring context switching
* 🛡️ Reduced Hallucinations: Relies on curated medical data rather than AI's implicit general knowledge
* 🌐 Open Ecosystem: Integrates with the growing MCP open standard

# Get Started
## Get your developer key from eka.care
> [!NOTE]  
> To obtain the `client-id`, and `client-token` reach out to us on ekaconnect@eka.care


## Installation and Setup for Claude Desktop
1. Install UV - https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#installation-methods
2. Install Claude desktop application - https://claude.ai/download
3. Locate the configuration file:
   - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   
   In case the file does not exist, create a new file named `claude_desktop_config.json` in the above directory.
4. Modify/Create the configuration file with the following settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "eka-mcp-server": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "eka_mcp_server",
        "--eka-api-host",
        "https://api.eka.care",
        "--client-id",
        "<client_id>",
        "--client-secret",
        "<client_secret>"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
5. Replace the placeholder values:
   - `<client_id>`: Your client ID
   - `<client_secret>`: Your client secret

## Debugging

Since MCP servers run over stdio, debugging can be challenging. For the best debugging experience, we recommend using the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector).

You can launch the MCP Inspector via [`npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) with this command:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uvx eka_mcp_server --eka-api-host https://api.eka.care --client-id <client_id> --client-secret <client_secret>
```
Upon launching, the Inspector will display a URL that you can access in your browser to begin debugging.

## Troubleshooting common issues

### spawn uvx ENOENT
This commonly happens when uvx is not installed or the command cannot be discovered.
![spawn uvx ENOENT screenshot](assets/uvx_debug.png)


1. Install uv through this command 
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

2. Find the path of our uvx installation
```bash
which uvx
```
The output might be something like this
```
> /opt/homebrew/bin/uvx
```

In your config, update the command to the full path of the `uvx` executable. For example:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "eka-mcp-server": {
      "command": "/opt/homebrew/bin/uvx",
      "args": [
        "eka_mcp_server",
        "--eka-api-host",
        "https://api.eka.care",
        "--client-id",
        "<client_id>",
        "--client-secret",
        "<client_secret>"
      ]
    } 
  }
}
```

Standardized guidelines, procedures, and decision pathways for healthcare professionals are published by medical bodies.
They serve as comprehensive roadmaps for clinical care, ensuring consistent and evidence-based treatment approaches.

Current Coverage:
* 175 medical conditions/tags
* 180 treatment protocols
* Multiple authoritative publishers

### Indian treatment protocol search workflow
1. For any given query, the LLM has to decide if the tag is supported or not through [this API](http://developer.eka.care/api-reference/eka_mcp/protocols/tags). During the init of the tool, we fetch the supported conditions.
2. Then, for the given tag, the LLM has to get the publishers that address that tag through [this API](http://developer.eka.care/api-reference/eka_mcp/protocols/publishers_by_tag).
3. Finally, with the tag, publisher and query, we fetch the relevant information from the repository of publishers through [this API](http://developer.eka.care/api-reference/eka_mcp/protocols/search).

# IWaVE
Image Wave Velocimetry Estimation

This library performs simultaneous analysis of 2D velocimetry and stream depth 
through 2D Fourier transform methods, with a physics-based approach. 
Unlike existing velocimetry approaches such as Particle Image Velocimetry or
Space-Time Image Velocimetry, the uniqueness of this approach lies in the following:
* velocities that are advective of nature, can be distinguished from other wave forms such as wind waves. 
  This makes the approach particularly useful in estuaries or river stretches affected strongly by wind,
  or in shallow streams in the presence of standing waves.
* The velocity is estimated based on the physical behavior of the water surface, taking into account the
  speed of propagation of waves and ripples relative to the main flow. This makes the approach more robust
  than traditional methods when there are no visible tracers.
* If the depth is not known, it can be estimated along with the optimization of x and y-directional velocity.
  Depth estimations are reliable only in fast and shallow flows, where wave dynamics are significantly
  affected by the finite depth.

The code is meant to offer an Application Programming Interface for use within more high level applications that 
utilize the method in conjunction with more high level functionalities such as Graphical User Interfaces, dashboards,
or automization routines.

The background and validation of methods are outlined and demonstrated in:

The code has been based on the original kOmega code developed by Giulio Dolcetti
(University of Trento, Italy) and released on https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7998891

The API of the code can:
* ingest a set of frames or frames taken from a video
* Slice these into "interrogation window" for which x- and y-directional velocities must be estimated
* Analyze advective velocities per interrogation window using the spectral analysis.
* Additionally estimate the water depth if unknown.

> [!NOTE]
> The sensitivity of water surface dynamics to variations in water depth is minimal. Depth estimations have specific requirements (see below) and can be prone to significant errors. Do not rely on depth estimates for any activity that could pose a risk.

## Installation

To install IWaVE, set up a python (virtual) environment and follow the instructions 
below:

For a direct installation of the latest release, please activate your environment if 
needed, and type

```commandline
pip install iwave
```

If you want to run the examples, you will need some extra dependencies. You can install these with

```commandline
pip install iwave[extra]
```

This sets you up with ability to retrieve a sample video, read video frames, and make plots.

## Examples

The main functionality is disclosed via an API class IWaVE.

### Creating an `IWaVE` instance

To create an IWaVE instance, you typically start with some settings for deriving analysis windows and 

```python
from iwave import Iwave

# Initialize IWaVE object
iw = Iwave(
    resolution=0.01,
    window_size=(128, 128),  # size of interrogation windows over which velocities are estimated
    overlap=(64, 64),  # overlap in space (y, x) used to select windows from images or frames
    time_size=250,  # amount of frames in time used for one spectral analysis
    time_overlap=125,  # amount of overlap in frames, used to establish time slices. Selecting half of 
        # time_size implies that you use a 50% overlap in time between frame sets.
   
)

# print some information about the IWaVE instance
print(iw)
```
Initializing a IWaVE instance is done by only setting some parameters for the analysis. At this stage we have not 
loaded any video in memory yet. The inputs have the following meaning:
* `window_size`: the size of so-called "interrogation windows" as a tuple (y, x), i.e. slices of pixels from the original
  frames that the images are subdivided in. Advective velocities are estimated per interrogation window by fitting a 
  spectral model over space and time within an interrogation window.
* `overlap`: overlaps between the interrogation window. `(64, 64)` here means that an overlap of 50% in both
  directions is applied.
* `time_size`: a spectral model is fitted over several subsets of frames and then averaged. This reduces noise. You 
  can define how large slices are. If you for instance read 300 frames, and use a time_size of 100, 3 subsets of 100 
  frames are derived, and the spectral model is fitted for all three and then averaged.
* `time_overlap`: also for the time, overlap can be used, in the same manner as for spatial overlap using `overlap`. 

> [!NOTE]
> Some important remarks on uncertainties: IWaVE employs a spectral approach to compare the observed water surface 
> dynamics with the theoretical expectations for given flow conditions. The key parameters determining the uncertainty 
> of measurements are the spectral resolution, the number of averages, and the sensitivity of surface dynamics to 
> velocity and water depth (see Dolcetti et al., 2022). 
> * The spectral resolution improves by increasing the window size and/or the time size. Optimal values of 
>   `window_size` should be similar to the water depth or larger. `time_size` should be larger than 5 seconds in most 
>   applications, ideally around 10 seconds.
> * The spatial and temporal resolution of the videos (e.g., the pixel size and frame rate) are less critical than 
>   the spectral resolution for the accuracy of the estimates. Reasonable results can usually be obtained also with 
>   a pixel size of ~5 cm and a frame rate of ~10 fps. Consider downsampling the data if memory or computational time 
>   are an issue.
> * More averages can significantly improve the convergence of the method. Ideally, one should aim for at least 3 
>   independent slices, regardless of the overlap (e.g., a 30-seconds-long video with a time_size of 10 seconds).
> * Short waves are more sensitive to flow velocity, while long waves are more sensitive to water depth. Therefore, a 
>   better spatial resolution (smaller pixel size) can improve velocity estimates, while a better spatial resolution 
>   (larger window size) can improve the depth estimates. However, only the waves with a wavelength similar or larger 
>   than the water depth feel the presence of the bed and can be used to estimate the water depth. Typically, these 
>   long waves form naturally in flows with Froude number in the range 0.4 to 1.0. These long waves (wavelength ~ 
>   $2\pi F^{2d}$ with $d$ being the depth, must be visible and their wavelength must be smaller than the window size 
>   for the depth estimation to be accurate. Otherwise, depth estimates may fail completely due to lack of sensitivity.  

### Reading in a video

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import patches

from iwave import Iwave, sample_data

iw = Iwave(
    resolution=0.01,  # resolution of videos you will analyze in meters. 
    window_size=(128, 128),  # size of interrogation windows over which velocities are estimated
    overlap=(64, 64),  # overlap in space (y, x) used to select windows from images or frames
    time_size=250,  # amount of frames used for one spectral analysis
    time_overlap=125,  # amount of overlap in frames, used to establish time slices. Selecting half of 
        # time_size implies that you use a 50% overlap in time between frame sets.
)

# retrieve a sample video from zenodo. This is built-in sample functionality...
fn_video = sample_data.get_sheaf_dataset()
iw.read_video(fn_video, start_frame=0, end_frame=500)

# NOTE: you can also read a list of ordered images with the frames per second set, using iw.read_imgs([...], fps=...)

print(iw)

# show the shape of the read images
print(f"Shape of the available images is {iw.imgs.shape}")

# show the shape of the manipulated windows
print(f"Shape of the available images is {iw.windows.shape}")

# create a new figure with two subplots in one row
f, axs = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=2, figsize=(16, 7))

# plot the first image with a patch at the first window and centers of rest in the first axes instance
first_window = patches.Rectangle((0, 0), 128, 128, linewidth=1, edgecolor='r', facecolor='none', label="first window")
xi, yi = np.meshgrid(iw.x, iw.y)
axs[0].imshow(iw.imgs[0], cmap="Greys_r")
axs[0].add_patch(first_window)
axs[0].plot(xi.flatten(), yi.flatten(), "o", label="centers")
axs[0].legend()
axs[0].set_title("First frame overview")
# plot the first window of the first image in the second axes instance
axs[1].imshow(iw.windows[0][0], cmap="Greys_r")
axs[1].set_title("First frame zoom first window")
plt.show()
```
You can now see that the IWaVE object shows:
* how many frames are available (if the video is shorter than `start_frame` and `end_frame` dictate, you'll get less     
  frames)
* how many time slices are expected from the amount of frames (overlap is included in this)
* The dimensions of the windows
* The y- and x-axis expected from the velocimetry analysis.

You can also see that the frames have actually been read into memory and windowed into a shape that has the following 
dimensions (in order):
* amount of windows
* amount of frames
* amount of y-pixels per window
* amount of x-pixels per window

Important to note is that the plotted first window on the right is normalized in time by subtracting for each pixel
and time step the temporal mean of that pixel. This is meant to reduce background noise. You may also normalize in 
space by passing `norm="xy"` during the initialization of the IWaVE instance. In this case, the mean of all pixels
in a window is subtracted.

Use `iw.read_imgs` as suggested in an inline comment to change reading to a set of frames stored as image files.
You then MUST provide frames-per-second explicitly yourself.

### Estimating x and y-directional velocity

```python
from iwave import Iwave, sample_data
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib import patches

# the velocity optimization process is parallelized, for this, you MUST wrap
# your script in a function and protect it with a `if __name__ == "main":` check
def main():  
  iw = Iwave(
      # repeat from example above...
  )
  
  iw.velocimetry(
    alpha=0.85,  # alpha represents the depth-averaged velocity over surface velocity [-]
    depth=0.3,  # depth in [m] has to be known or estimated. If depth = 0, then the depth is estimated.
    twosteps=False # option to perform the calculation in two steps. If True, the first step is calculated based on
                   # a reduced-dimension problem and serves as initialisation of the second step. 
  )
  
  ax = plt.axes()
  ax.imshow(iw.imgs[0], cmap="Greys_r")
  
  # add velocity vectors
  iw.plot_velocimetry(ax=ax, color="b", scale=10)  # you can add kwargs that belong to matplotlib.pyploy.quiver
  
  # plot the measured spectra and fitted dispersion relation (modify window_idx to visualize different windows)
  fig, axs = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=2, figsize=(15, 7))
  p1 = iw.plot_spectrum_fitted(window_idx=4, dim="x", ax=axs[0])
  axs[0].set_xlim([-100, 100])
  plt.colorbar(p1, ax=axs[0])
  p2 = iw.plot_spectrum_fitted(window_idx=4, dim="y", ax=axs[1])
  axs[1].set_xlim([-100, 100])
  plt.colorbar(p2, ax=axs[1])
  plt.show()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This estimates velocities in x and y-directions (u, v) per interrogation window and plots it on a background. If the 
water depth is not supplied, a water depth of $d=1$ m is assumed. With IWaVE, variations in water depth have a small but 
sometimes non-negligible impact on the velocity calculations. Therefore, it is recommended to set a representative 
value for depth, even when this is not known accurately.

### Optimisation algorithm

The flow parameters are calculated by maximising the cross-correlation between the measured spectrum of the surface elevation and a synthetic spectrum generated according to linear wave theory. This is done using a differential evolution algorithm (`scipy.optimize.differential_evolution`) which maximises the chances to identify a global maximum but may converge slowly, especially when the window size is large and/or there are more parameters to be estimated (e.g., also the water depth).

Setting `twosteps = True` (default is `False`) will run the optimisation in two steps. The first step employs a trimmed spectrum with reduced dimensions, and is used to identify an initial estimate of the flow velocity (depth effects are neglected during the first step, even when "depth" = 0). During the second step, the search of the optimum is confined within a region between 90% and 110% of the initial estimate. The two-steps approach can reduce the computation time by around 50% for large problems, but could be less robust and is more subject to the presence of outliers.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Optimization of the velocities occurs with a possibly large amount of spawned parallelized processes.
> The `if __name__ == "__main__":` construction around the script is necessary to optimize
> velocities without rerunning the entire script in each spawned subprocess. Like so:
>
> ```python
> import os
> import iwave
> 
> def main():
>     # ... here your core functionalities, making an IWaVE instance, reading video/frames
>     # calling `iw.velocimetry`, storing results, plotting and so on...
> 
> # at the end, call your function with main functionalities
> if __name__ == "__main__":
>     main()
> ```

> [!NOTE]
> By default, optimizations are parallelized using the maximum amount of CPUs available on your system. If you want to 
> change the amount of CPUs used for optimization, you can set the environment variable `IWAVE_NUM_THREADS` to the desired 
> number of CPUs.
> If you set this environment variable within a python script, you can also set it within the script itself.
> ```python
> import os
> os.environ["IWAVE_NUM_THREADS"] = "1"
> 
> # make sure you import iwave AFTER setting the environment variable
> import iwave
> ```


### Uncertainties

`iw.quality` is a quality 
metric that can represent the confidence in the optimised parameters. The quality $q$ is obtained from the ratio of the 
cost functions calculated with the measured spectrum and with the (ideal) synthetic spectrum, 
$q = 10 - 2\log_{10}\frac{c_m}{c_i}$, where $c_m$ is the measured cost, and $c_i$ the ideal cost. 
Therefore $0 < q < 10$, where 0 is the worst quality and 1 is the best quality. `iw.cost` is the 
measured cost. Acceptable quality may vary depending on window size, frame rate, and velocity and depth magnitude. 
Values of $q < 0.7$ are often indicative of poor fitting between measured and ideal spectra, which may indicate 
erroneous estimates of velocity. The water depth has a relatively small effect on the cost function, therefore high 
values of $q$ are not sufficient indicators of accurate depth estimation, although low values of $q$ are usually 
indicative of large uncertainties in both velocity and depth estimations.

`iw.status` returns a parameter indicating the exit condition. This corresponds to the "success" of the 
`differential_evolution` optimiser. `iw.message` returns the "message" field.


### Estimating water depth as well as x and y-directional velocity

The depth estimation is enabled by setting `depth = 0` in `iw.velocimetry`:

```python
from iwave import Iwave, sample_data
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib import patches

iw = Iwave(
    # repeat from example above...
)

iw.velocimetry(
  alpha=0.85,  # alpha represents the depth-averaged velocity over surface velocity [-]
  depth=0  # depth in [m] has to be known or estimated. If depth = 0, then the depth is estimated.
  twosteps=False # option to perform the calculation in two steps. If True, the first step is calculated based on
                 # a reduced-dimension problem and serves as initialisation of the second step. 
)

f, axs = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=3, figsize=(20, 5))
# Plot u against y for all x values
for i in range(iw.results["u"].shape[1]):
    axs[0].plot(iw.y, iw.results["u"][:, i], "o", label=f'x={iw.x[i]}')
axs[0].set_title("u vs y")
axs[0].set_xlabel("y")
axs[0].set_ylabel("u (m/s)")
# Plot v against y for all x values
for i in range(iw.results["v"].shape[1]):
    axs[1].plot(iw.y, iw.results["v"][:, i], "o", label=f'x={iw.x[i]}')
axs[1].set_title("v vs y")
axs[1].set_xlabel("y")
axs[1].set_ylabel("v (m/s)")
# Plot d against y for all x values
for i in range(iw.results["d"].shape[1]):
    axs[2].plot(iw.y, iw.results["d"][:, i], "o", label=f'x={iw.x[i]}')
axs[2].set_title("depth vs y")
axs[2].set_xlabel("y")
axs[2].set_ylabel("depth (m)")
plt.show()

```
This estimates velocities in x and y-directions (u, v) and water depth (d) per interrogation window and plots the results.
